      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he headdress of
      nationalities, and of public and private societies, has been in all ages a
      remarkable point of interest. Religion, Poetry, Politics, superstitions,
      and so forth, have all found expression by the way they dressed or covered
      their heads. Priests, soldiers, sailors, lawyers, traders, professions of
      all kinds are known by some peculiar covering of the head which they
      assume. None of these symbols are without interest, and most of them
      typify the character or intents of their wearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Paper Cap has added to its evident story a certain amount of mystery,
      favorable in so far as it permits us to exercise our ingenuity in devising
      a probable reason for its selection as the symbol of Labor. A very
      industrious search has not yet positively revealed it. No public or
      private collection of old prints of the seventeenth century that I have
      seen or heard from has any representation of an English working man
      wearing a Paper Cap. There is nothing of the kind in any <i>Hone&rsquo;s</i>
      four large volumes of curious matters; nor does <i>Notes and Queries</i>
      mention it. Not until the agitation and the political disturbance
      attending the Reform Bill, is it seen or mentioned. Then it may be found
      in the rude woodcuts and chap books of the time while in every town and
      village it soon became as familiar as the men who wore it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if the working man was looking for a symbol, there are many reasons
      why the Paper Cap would appeal to him. It is square, straight, upright; it
      has no brim. It permits the wearer to have full sight for whatever he is
      doing. It adds five inches or more to his height. It is cool, light and
      clean, and it is made of a small square of brown paper, and costs nothing.
      Every man makes his own paper cap, generally while he smokes his first
      morning pipe. It was also capable of assuming all the expressions of more
      pretentious head coverings&mdash;worn straight over the brows, it imparted
      a steady, business-like appearance. Tilted to one side, it showed the
      wearer to be interested in his own appearance. If it was pushed backward
      he was worried or uncertain about his work. On the heads of large
      masterful men it had a very &ldquo;hands off&rdquo; look. Employers readily understood
      its language.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not remember ever seeing anyone but working men wear a Paper Cap and
      they generally wore it with an &ldquo;air&rdquo; no pretender could assume. In the
      days of the Reform Bill a large company of Paper-Capped men were a company
      to be respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whose clever fingers first folded into such admirable shape a
      piece of brown paper seems to be unknown. I was once told he was a
      Guiseley man, again he was located at Burnley, or Idle. No one pretended
      to know his name. It was perhaps some tired weaver or carpenter whose head
      was throbbing in the sultry room and who feared to expose it to the full
      draught from some open window near his loom or bench. No other affiliation
      ever assumed or copied this cap in any way and for a century it has stood
      bravely out as the symbol of Labor; and has been respected and recognized
      as the badge of a courageous and intelligent class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if we do not positively know the facts about a certain matter, we can
      consider the circumstances surrounding it and deduct from them a
      likelihood of the truth; and I cannot avoid a strong belief that the Paper
      Cap was invented early in the agitation for the Reform Bill of A. D. 1832
      and very likely directly after the immense public meeting at New Hall,
      where thousands of English working men took bareheaded and with a Puritan
      solemnity, a solemn oath to stand by the Reform Bill until it was passed.
      It was not fully passed until 1884, and during that interval the Paper Cap
      was everywhere in evidence. Might it not be the symbol of that oath and a
      quiet recognition of brotherhood and comradeship in the wearing of it?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is certain that after this date, 1884, its use gradually declined, yet
      it is very far from being abandoned. In Nova Scotia and Canada it is still
      common, and we all know how slowly any personal or household habit dies in
      England. I am very sure that if I went to-morrow to any weaving town in
      the West Riding, I would see plenty of Paper Caps round the great centers
      of Industry. Last week only, I received half-a-dozen from a large building
      firm in Bradford.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a symbol of a sacred obligation between men, it is fitting and unique.
      It has never been imitated or copied, and if the habit of making a clean
      one every day is observed, then whatever it promises will be kept clean
      and clear in the memory. Long live the Paper Cap!
    </p>
    <p>
      My theory that the Paper Cap is associated with the Reform Bill, may, or
      may not be correct, but the union seems to be a very natural one&mdash;the
      Bill deserved the friendship and long adherence of the Cap, and the Cap
      deserved the freedom and strength of the Bill.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>EARLY ninety years
      ago, there was among the hills and wolds of the West Riding of Yorkshire a
      lovely village called Annis. It had grown slowly around the lords of the
      manor of Annis and consisted at the beginning of the nineteenth century of
      men and women whose time was employed in spinning and weaving. The looms
      were among their household treasures. They had a special apartment in
      every home, and were worthily and cheerfully worked by their owners. There
      were no mills in Annis then, and no masters, and no Trade Unions. They
      made their own work-hours and the Leeds Cloth Hall settled the worth of
      their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Antony Annis owned the greater part of the village. The pretty
      white stone cottages, each in its own finely cared-for garden, were,
      generally speaking, parts of his estate and he took a fatherly, masterly
      care of them. It was the squire who bought their work, and who had to
      settle with the Leeds Cloth Hall. It was the squire who found the wool for
      the women to spin and who supplied the men with the necessary yarns.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived close to them. His own ancient Hall stood on a high hill just
      outside the village!&mdash;a many-gabled building that had existed for
      nearly three hundred years. On this same hilly plateau was the church of
      Annis, still more ancient, and also the Rectory, a handsome residence that
      had once been a monastery. Both were in fine preservation and both were
      influential in the village life, though the ancient church looked down
      with grave disapproval on the big plain Wesleyan Chapel that had stolen
      from it the lawful allegiance it had claimed for nearly five centuries.
      Yet its melodious chimes still called at all canonical hours to worship,
      and its grand old clock struck in clarion tones the hours of their labor
      and their rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were handsome men in this locality, strong and powerful, with a
      passion for horses and racing that not even Methodism could control. Their
      women were worthy of them, tall and fine-looking, with splendid coloring,
      abundant hair, and not unfrequently eyes like their Lancashire neighbors;
      gray and large, with long dark lashes, and that &ldquo;look&rdquo; in them which the
      English language has not yet been able to find a word for. They were busy
      wives, they spun the wool for their husbands&rsquo; looms and they reared large
      families of good sons and daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The majority of the people were Methodists&mdash;after their kind. The
      shepherds on the mountains around took as naturally to Methodism as a babe
      to its mother&rsquo;s milk. They lived with their flocks of Merino sheep half
      their lives in the night and its aërial mysteries. The doctrine of
      &ldquo;Assurance&rdquo; was their own spiritual confidence, and John Wesley&rsquo;s
      Communion with the other world they certified by their own experience. As
      to the weavers, they approved of a religion that was between God and
      themselves only. They had a kind of feudal respect for Squire Annis. He
      made their pleasant independent lives possible and they would take a word
      or two of advice or reproof from him; and also the squire knew what it was
      to take a glass of strong ale when he had been to a race and seen the
      horse he had backed, win it&mdash;but the curate! The curate knew nothing
      about horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      If they saw the curate approaching them they got out of his way; if they
      saw the squire coming they waited for him. He might call them idle lads,
      but he would walk to their looms with them and frankly admire the
      excellence of their work, and perhaps say: &ldquo;I wonder at a fine lad like
      thee leaving a bit of work like that. If I could do it I would keep at it
      daylight through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And the weaver would look him bravely in the face and answer&mdash;&ldquo;Not
      thou, squire! It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit like thee. I see thee on t&rsquo; grandstand,
      at ivery race I go to. I like a race mysen, it is a varry democratic
      meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the squire would give the child at the spinning wheel a shilling and
      go off with a laugh. He knew that in any verbal contest with Jimmy Riggs,
      he would not be the victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also if the squire met any mother of the village he would touch his hat
      and listen to what she wished to say. And if one of her lads was in
      trouble for &ldquo;catching a rabbit on the common&rdquo;&mdash;though he suspected
      the animal was far more likely from his own woods&mdash;he always promised
      to help him and he always did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our women have such compelling eyes,&rdquo; he would remark in excuse, &ldquo;and
      when they would look at you through a mist of tears a man that can say
      &lsquo;no&rsquo; to them isn&rsquo;t much of a man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally proud, the squire was nevertheless broadly affable. He could not
      resist the lifted paper cap of the humblest man and his lofty stature and
      dignified carriage won everyone&rsquo;s notice. His face was handsome, and
      generally wore a kind thoughtful expression, constantly breaking into
      broad smiles. And all these advantages were seconded and emphasized by his
      scrupulous dress, always fit and proper for every occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was riding slowly through the village one morning when he met a
      neighbor with whom he had once been on intimate friendly terms. It was
      John Thomas Bradley, who had just built a large mill within three miles of
      Annis village and under the protecting power of the government had filled
      it with the latest power-looms and spinning jennies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Annis!&rdquo; he said cheerfully. &ldquo;How dost tha do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do none the better for thy late doings. I can tell thee that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is tha meaning my new building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is tha ashamed to speak its proper name? It&rsquo;s a factory, call it that.
      And I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder, if tha hes been all through Annis, trying to get
      some o&rsquo; my men to help thee run it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then. I wouldn&rsquo;t hev a man that hes been in thy employ, unless it
      were maybe Jonathan Hartley. They are all petted and spoiled to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask Jonathan to come to thy machine shop. He wouldn&rsquo;t listen to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to his Chartist talk. I would want to cut
      the tongue out o&rsquo; his head. I would that! O Annis, we two hev been friends
      for forty years, and our fathers were hand and glove before us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Bradley, I know! But now thou art putting bricks and iron before
      old friendship and before all humanity; for our workers are men,
      first-rate men, too&mdash;and thou knows it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose they are, what by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this; thou can&rsquo;t drive men by machines of iron tethered to steam! It
      is an awful mastership, that it is! It is the drive of the devil. The
      slaves we are going to set free in the West Indies are better off, far
      better off than factory slaves. They hed at any rate human masters, that
      like as not, hev a heart somewhere about them. Machines hev no heart, and
      no sympathy and no weakness of any make. They are regular, untiring,
      inexorable, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do more work and better work than men can do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe they do, and so men to keep up wi&rsquo; them, hev to work longer, and
      harder, and wi&rsquo; constantly increasing peril o&rsquo; their lives. Yes, for the
      iron master, the man must work, work, work, till he falls dead at its iron
      feet. It is a cruel bad do! A bad do! Bradley, how can thou fashion to do
      such things? Oh, it isn&rsquo;t fair and right, and thou knows it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annis, thou may come to see things a good deal different and tha
      knows well I can&rsquo;t quarrel wi&rsquo; thee. Does ta think I can iver forget March
      21, 1823, when thou saved me and mine, from ruin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let that pass, Bradley. It went into God&rsquo;s memory&mdash;into God&rsquo;s memory
      only. Good morning to thee!&rdquo; And the men parted with a feeling of kindness
      between them, though neither were able to put it into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the interview made the squire unhappy and he instantly thought of
      going home and telling his wife about it. &ldquo;I can talk the fret away with
      Annie,&rdquo; he thought, and he turned Annisward.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Madam Annis was sitting in the morning sunshine, with her
      finest set of English laces in her hand. She was going carefully over
      them, lifting a stitch here and there, but frequently letting them fall to
      her lap while she rested her eyes upon the wealth of spring flowers in the
      garden which at this point came close up to the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Annis was fifty years old but still a beautiful woman, full of life,
      and of all life&rsquo;s sweetest and bravest sympathies. She wore an Indian
      calico&mdash;for Manchester&rsquo;s printed calicoes were then far from the
      perfection they have since arrived at&mdash;and its bizarre pattern, and
      wonderfully brilliant colors, suited well her fine proportions and regal
      manner. A small black silk apron with lace pockets and trimmings of lace,
      and black silk bows of ribbon&mdash;a silver chatelaine, and a little lace
      cap with scarlet ribbons on it, were the most noticeable items of her
      dress though it would hardly do to omit the scarlet morocco slippers,
      sandaled and trimmed with scarlet ribbon and a small silver buckle on the
      instep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she heard rapid footsteps descending the great stairway, and in
      the same moment she erected her position, and looked with kind but steady
      eyes at the door. It opened with a swift noiseless motion and a girl of
      eighteen years entered; a girl tall and slender, with masses of bright
      brown hair, a beautiful mouth and star-like eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how am I to go to London this spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not yet in thy father&rsquo;s intentions about the journey, Katherine. He
      promised to take thee when he went up to the House. If he forswears his
      promise, why then, child, I know not. Ask him when he is going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did so this morning and he said I must excuse him at present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he will take thee, later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bit different, mother; and it isn&rsquo;t what he promised me. It is
      my wish to go now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no way for thee to go now. Let London wait for its proper time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alura Percival, and Lady Capel, and Agatha Wickham, are already on their
      way there. Captain Chandos told me so an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Has he learned how to speak the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like other people, he speaks as much of it as is profitable to him. If
      father is not going just yet cannot you go, dear mother? You know Jane
      will expect us to keep our promise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane knows enough of the times to understand why people are now often
      prevented from keeping their promises. Is Jane going much out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great deal and she says Lord Leyland wishes her to keep open house for
      the rest of the season. Of course, I ought to be with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see no &lsquo;ought&rsquo; in the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is my sister and can introduce me to noblemen and distinguished
      people. She desires me to come at once. I have just had a letter from her.
      And what about my frocks, mother? If father is not ready to go you could
      go with me, dear mother! That would be just as well, perhaps better!&rdquo; And
      she said these flattering words from the very summit of her splendid eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are people here in Annis who are wanting bread and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is their own fault, mother, and you know it. The Annis weavers are a
      lot of stubborn old fogies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have only taken this world as they found it. Isn&rsquo;t that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is all wrong. Every generation ought to make it better. You said
      that to father last night, I heard you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t always talk to thy father as I do to thee. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a bit
      suitable. Whatever were thou talking to Captain Chandos for&mdash;if he is
      a captain&mdash;I doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His uncle bought him a commission in The Scotch Greys. His mother is
      Scotch. I suppose he has as much right there, as the rest of the Hanover
      fools.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if thou are going to indulge thyself in describing people in the army
      and the court thou wilt get thy father into trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw father talking to Squire Bradley for a long time this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what mood? I hope they were not&mdash;quarreling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were disputing rather earnestly, father looked troubled, and so did
      Bradley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They were talking of the perishing poor and the dreadful state of.
      England no doubt. It&rsquo;s enough to trouble anybody, I&rsquo;m sure of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it is, but then father has a bad way of making things look worse than
      they are. And he isn&rsquo;t friendly with Bradley now. That seems wrong,
      mother, after being friends all their live-long lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is wrong. It is a bit of silent treason to each other. It is that! And
      how did thou happen to see them talking this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They met on the village green. I think Bradley spoke first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant it. Bradley is varry good-natured, and he thought a deal o&rsquo; 
      thy father. How did thou happen to be on the green so early in the day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was sitting with Faith Foster, and her parlor window faces the Green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith Foster! And pray what took thee to her house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was helping her to sew for a lot of Annis babies that are nearly naked,
      and perishing with cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was a varry queer thing for thee to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought so myself even while I was doing it&mdash;but Faith works as
      she likes with everyone. You can&rsquo;t say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to anything she wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such nonsense! I&rsquo;m fairly astonished at thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever seen Faith, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I! It is none o&rsquo; my place to visit a Methodist preacher&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody visits her&mdash;rich and poor. If you once meet her she can
      bring you back to her as often as she wishes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such women are very dangerous people to know. I&rsquo;d give her a wide border.
      Keep thyself to thyself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to London. Maybe, mother, I ought to tell you that our Dick is
      in love with Faith Foster. I am sure he is. I do not see how he can help
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick and his father will hev that matter to settle, and there is enough
      on hand at present&mdash;what with mills, and steam, and working men, not
      to speak of rebellion, and hunger, and sore poverty. Dick&rsquo;s love affairs
      can wait awhile. He hes been in love with one and twenty perfect beauties
      already. Some of them were suitable fine girls, of good family, and Lucy
      Todd and Amy Schofield hed a bit of money of their awn. Father and I would
      hev been satisfied with either o&rsquo; them, but Dick shied off from both and
      went silly about that French governess that was teaching the Saville
      girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think Dick will shy off from Faith Foster. I am sure that he has
      never yet dared to say a word of love to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dared! What nonsense! Dick wasn&rsquo;t born in Yorkshire to take a dare from
      any man or woman living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, I have made you wise about Faith Foster. A word is all you
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I the girl pretty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty She is adorable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean that she is a fine looking girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that she is a little angel. You think of violets if she comes
      where you are. Her presence is above a charm and every door flies open to
      her. She is very small. Mary Saville, speaking after her French governess,
      calls her <i>petite</i>. She is, however, beautifully fashioned and has
      heavenly blue, deep eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me nothing more about her. I should never get along with such a
      daughter-in-law. How could thou imagine it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother, I have told you all my news, what have you to say to me
      about London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will speak to thy father some time to-day. I shall hev to choose both a
      proper way and a proper time; thou knows that. Get thy frocks ready and I
      will see what can be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If father will not take me, I shall write to Aunt Josepha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou will do nothing of that kind. Thy Aunt Josepha is a very peculiar
      woman. We heard from the Wilsons that she hed fairly joined the radicals
      and was heart and soul with the Cobden set. In her rough, broad way she
      said to Mrs. Wilson, that steam and iron and red brick had come to take
      possession of England and that men and women who could not see that were
      blind fools and that a pinch of hunger would do them good. She even
      scolded father in her letter two weeks ago, and father her <i>eldest
      brother</i>. Think of that! I was shocked, and father felt it far more
      than I can tell thee. <i>Why!</i>&mdash;he wouldn&rsquo;t hev a mouthful of
      lunch, and that day we were heving hare soup; and him so fond of hare
      soup.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember. Did father answer that letter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think he did. He told Josepha Temple a little of her duty; he
      reminded her, in clear strong words, that he stood in the place of her
      father, and the head of the Annis family, and that he had a right to her
      respect and sympathy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Aunt Josepha say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She wrote a laughable, foolish letter back and said: &lsquo;As she was two
      years older than Antony Annis she could not frame her mouth to &lsquo;father&rsquo; 
      him, but that she was, and always would be, his loving sister.&rsquo; You see
      Josepha Temple was the eldest child of the late squire, your father came
      two years after her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you know that Dick had been staying with her for a week?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Dick wrote us while there. Father is troubled about it. He says Dick
      will come home with a factory on his brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must stand by Dick, mother. We are getting so pinched for money you
      know, and Lydia Wilson told me that everyone was saying: &lsquo;Father was
      paying the men&rsquo;s shortage out of his estate.&rsquo; They were sorry for father,
      and I don&rsquo;t like people being sorry for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And pray what has Lydia Wilson to do with thy father&rsquo;s money and
      business? Thou ought to have asked her that question. Whether thou
      understands thy father or not, whatever he does ought to be right in thy
      eyes. Men don&rsquo;t like explaining their affairs to anyone; especially to
      women, and I doan&rsquo;t believe they iver tell the bottom facts, even to
      themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, if things come to the worst, would it do for me to ask Jane for
      money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at thee. Jane niver gives or lends anything to anybody, but to
      Jane.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says she is going to entertain many great people this winter and she
      wishes me to meet them so I think she might help me to make a good
      appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if she asked thy father to pay her for introducing thee
      into the titled set. She writes about them and talks about them and I dare
      warrant dreams about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she ever forget that she has managed to become Lady Leyland? She
      thinks that two syllables before her name makes her better than her own
      family. <i>Chut!</i> Katherine! Leyland is only the third of the line. It
      was an official favor, too&mdash;what merit there is in it has not yet
      been discovered. We have lived in this old house three hundred years, and
      three hundred before that in old Britain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Britain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure&mdash;in Glamorganshire, I believe. Ask thy father. He knows
      his genealogy by heart. I see him coming. Go and meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, mother, but I think I will write a short note to Aunt Josepha. I
      will not name business, nor money, nor even my desire to make a visit to
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Write such a letter if thou wishes but take the result&mdash;whatever it
      is&mdash;in a good humor. Remember that thy aunt&rsquo;s temper, and her words
      also, are entirely without frill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That, of course. It is the Annis temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the English temper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, mother, things seem to be ordered in a very unhappy fashion but I
      suppose we might as well take to them at once. Indeed, we shall be
      compelled to do it, if so be, it pleases them above.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; answered Madam. &ldquo;But, Katherine, The Hands of Compulsion
      generally turn out to be The Hands of Compassion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katherine smiled happily, the door opened, and the next moment she gave
      the smile in a kiss to her father, as he clasped her fondly in his arms,
      crying, &ldquo;Eh, my joy! I am glad to see thee!&rdquo; Then the two women made that
      charming fuss over his &ldquo;tired look,&rdquo; which is so consoling to men fresh
      from the slings and arrows of an outrageous world that will not do as they
      want it to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his family life the squire still retained many old-fashioned customs,
      and his dinner at one o&rsquo;clock was a settled ceremony. This day, in the
      very middle of it, Katherine said, &ldquo;I saw you, father, this morning when
      you were talking to Mr. Bradley on the Green&mdash;about ten o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I saw thee trailing through the low meadows with Bradley&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he came home last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And went out t&rsquo; varry next morning, to meet thee in t&rsquo; low meadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you say, he happened to meet me in the low meadow, it would be
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whativer hed the lad to do in my meadow so early in the morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you call half-past ten early, dad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I call it too early for thee to be traipsing through t&rsquo; wet grass with
      Henry Bradley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us keep to facts, dear father. The grass was quite dry&mdash;too dry.
      Joel was wishing for rain; he said, &lsquo;Master so pampered his cattle, that
      they perfectly thought scorn of half-cured grass.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art trying to slip by my question and I&rsquo;m not going to let thee do
      it. What was John Henry Bradley doing wi&rsquo; thee in the low meadow this
      morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He brought me a letter from my brother Dick. Dick and Harry have been in
      London together, and they stayed four days with Aunt Josepha. They liked
      her very much. They took her to the opera and the play and she snubbed
      O&rsquo;Connell and some other famous men and told them to let her alone, that
      she had two innocent lads in her care&mdash;and so on. You know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was he making love to thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not ask me a question of that kind, dad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou need not tell me, what I should, or should not do. I hed learned all
      that, before thou wer born. And I&rsquo;ll tell thee plainly that I will not hev
      any lovemaking between thee and Harry Bradley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, father. If you are going to the stable will you tell someone
      to have my saddle horse at the door in half-an-hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, I will. If tha wants a ride and will go to Yoden Bridge, I&rsquo;ll
      go with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like that but I promised to help Faith Foster, who is making
      clothing for the naked, shivering babies in Annis village. When Oddy&rsquo;s
      little girl died a week ago, there wasn&rsquo;t a night-gown in the house to
      bury it in. Its mother tore a breadth out of her one petticoat and folded
      her baby in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Katherine Annis! Surely that tale is not true!&rdquo; cried Madam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Alas, it is too true! The baby&rsquo;s one little gown was not fit even for the
      grave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Squire sat down and covered his face with his hands and when Katherine
      left the room he looked up pitifully at his wife. And she stooped and
      kissed him and as she did so comforted him with broken words of affection
      and assurances that it was not his fault&mdash;&ldquo;thou hast pinched us all a
      bit to keep the cottage looms busy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;thou couldn&rsquo;t do more than
      that, could thou, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I was doing right. Is there any other way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou could build&mdash;like the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer the remark but stood up hurriedly, saying, &ldquo;I must go
      and order Katherine&rsquo;s mount and she will expect me to put her up. After
      that I may go to Yoden Bridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madam sighed and turned hopelessly away. &ldquo;When will he listen to reason?&rdquo;
       she whispered, but there was no answer.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is during the
      hungry years of the thirties and forties of the nineteenth century that
      the great body of Englishmen and Englishwomen reveal themselves most nobly
      and clearly in their national character. They were years of hunger and
      strife but it is good to see with what ceaseless, persistent bravery they
      fought for their ideals year after year, generation after generation,
      never losing hope or courage but steadily working and waiting for the
      passage of that great Reform Bill, which would open the door for their
      recognition at least as members of the body politic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this Reform Bill terrified the aristocracy and great land holders and
      they were sure that its passage would sweep away both the monarchy and the
      House of Lords. What else could be looked for if the franchise was given
      to the laborer and the mechanic? The Bill had been well received by the
      House of Commons, but rejected by the House of Lords on the twentieth day
      of the previous October; and the condition of the country was truly
      alarming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Annis reminded her daughter of this fact but Katherine was not to be
      frightened. &ldquo;Your father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;has just told us about the riot and
      outrages at Derby and the burning of Nottingham Castle by a frantic mob
      and the press says&mdash;&lsquo;the people in London are restless and full of
      passion.&rsquo; Still more to be wondered at is the letter which Thomas Attwood,
      the great banker, has just sent to the Duke of Wellington. In this letter
      he dared to threaten the government, to tell them he would march on London
      with a hundred thousand men, in order to inquire why the Reform Bill was
      hindered and delayed. This morning&rsquo;s paper comments on this threat and
      says, The Duke of Wellington is not afraid of this visit, but would rather
      it was not paid.&rsquo; All the way up to London there is rioting. It is not a
      fit journey for thee to take. Mind what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, only think! I might have been in the Ladies&rsquo; Gallery, in the
      House. I might have heard Mr. Macaulay&rsquo;s answer to the Lord&rsquo;s denial, with
      his grand question to the Commons, &lsquo;Ought we to abandon the Reform Bill
      because the Lords have rejected it? No! We must respect the lawful
      privileges of their House, but we ought also to assert our own.&rsquo; No wonder
      the Commons cheered, and cheered, and cheered him. Oh, how gladly I would
      have helped them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going too far and too fast, Katherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father ought to have been in the House on the third of February and it is
      now the seventh of March: Is that right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many landed men will not go to this session. The Reform Bill,
      re-written by Lord Russell, is to come up again and father does not want
      to vote either for, or against it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hes his reasons. I doan&rsquo;t know that his reasons are any business of
      thine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Bradley was explaining things to me this morning, and I am for the
      Reform Bill. I am sure the people are right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say as much on thy opinion. Wisdom wasn&rsquo;t born wi&rsquo; thee and I
      doan&rsquo;t expect she will die wi&rsquo; thee. I think if thou went to London this
      spring thou would make more enemies than thou could manage. Father is
      following my advice in staying home, and London isn&rsquo;t a fit place for a
      young girl like thee and the way there is full of rioters. Thy father is a
      landed man and he doesn&rsquo;t believe in giving every weaver and hedger and
      ditcher a voice in the government of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry Bradley says, some of their leaders and speakers are very clever
      eloquent men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t talk nonsense after Harry Bradley. Who&rsquo;s Harry Bradley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is my friend, mother. We have been friends nearly twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not you! It is not yet eighteen years since thou showed thy face in this
      world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was speaking generally, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but there&rsquo;s something wrong in that way! A lot o&rsquo; bother can come out
      of it. I wouldn&rsquo;t mind anything Harry Bradley says, thy father won&rsquo;t hev
      any nonsense about him. I can tell thee that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father is so set in his own way. No one suits him lately. We met Captain
      Chandos last Monday, and he would hardly notice him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there are plenty of folk no one can suit, and varry often
      they can&rsquo;t suit themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t care about Chandos, mother; but I feel angry when Harry is
      slighted. You see, mother, I might come to marry Harry Bradley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope thou won&rsquo;t be so far left to thysen, as that would mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you would be wise to let me go to London. A girl must have a lover,
      or she feels out in the cold, and Harry is the best specimen of a man
      round about Annis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Let me tell thee that I hev noticed that the girls who never
      throw a line into the sea of marriage, do a deal better than them that are
      allays fishing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps so, but then there is the pleasure of throwing the line.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps the pleasure of being caught by some varry undesireable
      fisherman for tha needn&rsquo;t think that women are the only fishers. The men
      go reg&rsquo;lar about that business and they will soon find out that thou hes a
      bit o&rsquo; money o&rsquo; thy awn and are well worth catching. See if they doan&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I want to go to London and see the passing of the great Reform
      Bill. I am in love with those brave men Earl Grey and Lord Russell and Mr.
      Macaulay, who dared to speak up for the poor, before all England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather think they are all married men, Katherine, and marrying for love
      is an unwise and generally an unprofitable bit of business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business and Love have nothing to do with each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh, but they hev!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall marry for love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, marry for love, but love wisely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money is only one thing, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, but it is a rayther important thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might persuade father that he had better take me to London out of
      Harry&rsquo;s way. Dear mammy, do this for your little girl, won&rsquo;t you? You can
      always get round father in some way or other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will ask thy father again but I shall take no roundabout way.
      Straightforrard is the best. And I am above a bit astonished at thee, a
      Yorkshire lass, thinking of any crooked road to what thou wants! If tha
      can&rsquo;t get thy way openly and fairly make up thy mind any other way isn&rsquo;t
      worth while, for it will be full of ups and downs, and lonely bits, and
      stony bits, and all sorts and kinds of botherations. Keep these words in
      thy mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll ask thy father again, to take thee with him to London&mdash;if
      he goes himsen&mdash;if he does not go at all, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must find out some other way, and really the most straightforward way
      would be to marry Harry Bradley, and go to London with him as a wedding
      trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must stop talking nonsense or else it will stop my talking one word
      for thy wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just joking, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always keep everything straight between thysen and thy mother. The first
      deception between me and thee opens the gates of Danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will never forget that, mother. And if I should go away I ask you to
      take my place with Faith Foster, who is making clothing for the poor in
      the village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Katherine, what with one thing and what with another, I doan&rsquo;t know
      what tha wants. Does tha know thysen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I think it would look better if the Hall should trouble itself a
      little about the suffering in the village. Faith Foster is the only person
      doing anything. I was helping her, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think thou would have told thysen that it was varry forrard in a
      young person putting herself in my place without even a word to me on the
      matter. She ought to hev come and told me what was needed and offered her
      help to me. Thy father is Lord of the Manor of Annis, and it is his
      business to see the naked clothed. I wonder at thee letting any one take
      my place and then asking me to help and do service for them. That is a bit
      beyond civility, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was very thoughtless. I am sorry I did it. I was so touched by Faith&rsquo;s
      description of the hunger and nakedness in Abram Oddy&rsquo;s family, that I
      thought of nothing but how to relieve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well! It is all right, someway or other. I see father coming
      towards the house. I wonder what he is wanting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is walking so rapidly and looks so happy, something must have
      pleased him. I will go away, mother. This may be a good hour for our
      request.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>our?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katherine had disappeared. She left the room by one door as the squire
      entered by the other. Madam rose to meet him but before she could speak
      the squire had kissed her and was saying in glad eager tones, &ldquo;I hev
      hurried a bit, my Joy, to tell thee that both thysen and Katherine can go
      wi&rsquo; me to London. I had a lump of good fortune this afternoon. Mark
      Clitheroe sent me the thousand pounds he owed, when he broke up five years
      ago. He told me he wouldn&rsquo;t die till he had paid it; and I believed him.
      The money came to-day and it came with a letter that does us both credit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However has Clitheroe made a thousand pounds to spare since his smash-up?
      Thou said, it wer a varry complete ruin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was all of that, yet he tells me, he will be able to pay the last
      farthing he owes to anyone, during this year some time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It caps me! How hes he made the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Annie, his father built a factory for him and filled it with the
      finest power-looms and he says he hes been doing a grand business. Old
      Clitheroe hed allays told him he was wasting time and good brass in hand
      weaving but Mark would hev his awn way, and somehow his awn way took him
      to ruin in three years. I was his main creditor. Well, well! I am both
      astonished and pleased, I am that! Now get thysen and Katherine ready for
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t really want to go, Antony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot do without thee. Thou wilt hev to go, and there is
      Katherine, too! Ten to one, she will need a bit of looking after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When art thou going to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for a month. I must see to the sowing of the land&mdash;the land
      feeds us. I thought, though, it would be right to give thee the bit o&rsquo; 
      change and pleasure to think about and talk about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does thou intend to stay while in London?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thinking of the Clarendon Hotel for thee and mysen. I suppose
      Katherine can be comfortable and welcome at her sister&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly she can. Jane isn&rsquo;t anything but kind at heart. It is just her
      <i>you-shallness</i> that makes her one-sided to live with. But Katherine
      can hold her own side, without help, she can that! And if thou art bound
      for London, then London is the place where my heart will be and we will go
      together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art a good wife to me, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I promised thee to be a good wife, and I&rsquo;m Yorkshire enough
      to keep a promise&mdash;good or bad. I am glad thou art going to the
      Clarendon. It is a pleasant house but thy sister Josepha is a bit
      overbearing, isn&rsquo;t she, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She does not overbear me. I am her eldest brother. I make her remember
      that. Howiver, I shall hev to listen to such a lot o&rsquo; strong language in
      the House that I must hev only thee about me when I can get away from
      committees, and divisions, taking of votes, and the like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time the squire had filled his pipe, and seated himself in his
      favorite corner on that side of the hearth, that had no draughts whichever
      way the wind blew. Then Madam said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave thee a few minutes,
      Antony. I am going to tell Katherine that thou art going to take her to
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varry well. I&rsquo;ll give thee five minutes, then thou must come back here,
      for I hev something important to tell thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine will want to come back here with me. She will be impatient to
      thank thee for thy goodness and to coax some sovereigns in advance for a
      new dress and the few traveling things women need when they are on the
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou hed better advise her to wait until supper time. When the day&rsquo;s
      work is all done I can stand a bit of cuddling and petting and I doan&rsquo;t
      mind waring a few sovereigns for things necessary. Of course, I know the
      little wench will be happy and full o&rsquo; what she is going to see, and to
      do, and to hear. Yet, Annie, I hev some important thoughts in my mind now
      and I want thy help in coming to their settlement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony Annis! I <i>am</i> astonished at thee, I am that! When did thou
      ever need or take advice about thy awn business? Thou hes sense for all
      that can be put up against thy opinion, without asking advice from man or
      woman&mdash;&lsquo;specially woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be so, Annie, perhaps it <i>is</i> so, but thou art different.
      Thou art like mysen and it&rsquo;s only prudent and kind to talk changes over
      together. For thou hes to share the good or the bad o&rsquo; them, so it is only
      right thou should hev time to prepare for whatever they promise. Sit thee
      down beside me. Now, then, this is what happened just as soon as I hed
      gotten my money&mdash;and I can assure thee, that a thousand pounds in a
      man&rsquo;s pocket is a big set up&mdash;I felt all my six feet four inches and
      a bit more, too&mdash;well, as I was going past the Green to hev a talk
      wi&rsquo; Jonathan Hartley, I saw Mr. Foster come to his door and stand there.
      As he was bare-headed, I knew he was waiting to speak to me. I hev liked
      the man&rsquo;s face and ways iver since he came to the village, and when he
      offered his hand and asked me to come in I couldn&rsquo;t resist the kindness
      and goodness of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou went into the preacher&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surely did, and I am glad of it. I think a deal o&rsquo; good may come from
      the visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did thou see his daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did and I tell thee she is summat to see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she is really beautiful?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and more than that. She was sitting sewing in a plain, small parlor
      but she seemed to be sitting in a circle of wonderful peace. All round her
      the air looked clearer than in the rest of the room and something sweet
      and still and heavenly happy came into my soul. Then she told me all about
      the misery in the cottages and said it had now got beyond individual help
      and she was sure if thou knew it, and the curate knew it, some proper
      general relief could be carried out. She had began, she said, &lsquo;with the
      chapel people,&rsquo; but even they were now beyond her care; and she hoped thou
      would organize some society and guide all with thy long and intimate
      knowledge of the people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did thou say to this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I said I knew thou would do iverything that it was possible to do. And I
      promised that thou would send her word when to come and talk the ways and
      means over with thee and a few others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it would be right wi&rsquo; thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine says that our Dick is in love wi&rsquo; the preacher&rsquo;s daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder, and if a man hedn&rsquo;t already got the only perfect woman
      in the world for his awn you could not blame him. No, you could not blame
      him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou must hev stayed awhile there for it is swinging close to five
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, but I wasn&rsquo;t at the preacher&rsquo;s long. I went from his house to
      Jonathan Hartley&rsquo;s, and I smoked a pipe with him, and we hed a long talk
      on the situation of our weavers. Many o&rsquo; them are speaking of giving-in,
      and going to Bradley&rsquo;s factory, and I felt badly, and I said to Jonathan,
      &lsquo;I suppose thou is thinking of t&rsquo; same thing.&rsquo; And he looked at me, Annie,
      and I was hot wi&rsquo; shame, and I was going to tell him so, but he looked at
      me again, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Nay, nay, squire, thou didn&rsquo;t mean them words, and we&rsquo;ll say nothing
      about them&rsquo;; so we nodded to each other, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be sure whether or
      not we wer&rsquo; not both nearer tears than we&rsquo;d show. Anyway, he went on as if
      nothing had happened, telling me about the failing spirit of the workers
      and saying a deal to excuse them. &lsquo;Ezra Dixon&rsquo;s eldest and youngest child
      died yesterday and they are gathering a bit of money among the chapel folk
      to bury them.&rsquo; Then I said: &lsquo;Wait a minute, Jonathan,&rsquo; and I took out of
      my purse a five pound note and made him go with it to the mother and so
      put her heart at ease on that score. You know our poor think a parish
      funeral a pitiful disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Antony, if that was what kept thee, thou wert well kept. Faith
      Foster is right. I ought to be told of such sorrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure we both ought to know, but tha sees, Annie, my dearie, we hev
      been so much better off than the rest of weaving villages that the workers
      hev not suffered as long and as much as others. But what&rsquo;s the use of
      making excuses? I am going to a big meeting of weavers on Saturday night.
      It is to be held in t&rsquo; Methodist Chapel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony! Whatever art thou saying? What will the curate say? What will all
      thy old friends say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, I hev got to a place where I don&rsquo;t care a button what they say. I
      hev some privileges, I hope, and taking my awn way is one o&rsquo; them. The
      curate hes been asked to lend his sanction to the meeting, and the men are
      betting as to whether he&rsquo;ll do so or not. If I was a betting man I would
      say &lsquo;No&rsquo;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His bishop. The bishops to a man were against the Reform Bill. Only one
      is said to have signed for it. That is not sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do you blame him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I&rsquo;m sorry for any man, that hesn&rsquo;t the gumption to please his awn
      conscience, and take his awn way. However, his career is in the bishop&rsquo;s
      hand, and he&rsquo;s varry much in love with Lucy Landborde.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lucy Landborde! That handsome girl! How can he fashion himself to make up
      to Lucy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She thinks he is dying of love for her, so she pities him. Women are a
      soft lot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is mebbe a good thing for men that women are a soft lot. Go on with
      thy story. It&rsquo;s fair wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Foster will preside, and they&rsquo;ll ask the curate to record
      proceedings. St. George Norris and Squire Charington and the Vicar of
      Harrowgate will be on the platform, I hear. The vicar is going to marry
      Geraldine Norris next week to a captain in the Guards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Antony, thou finds out iverything going on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. That is part o&rsquo; my business as Lord of the Manor. Well tha
      sees now, that it is going to be a big meeting, especially when they add
      to it a Member of Parliament, a Magistrate, and a Yorkshire Squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who art thou talking about now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mysen! Antony Annis! Member of Parliament, Squire of Annis and Deeping
      Wold, and Magistrate of the same district.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, I had forgotten I was such a big lady. And I am to go to
      London with thee. I am as set up about that as a child would be. I think I
      ought to go and tell Katherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe it would be the kind thing. Sharing a pleasure doubles it;&rdquo; and as
      the squire uttered the words, Katherine rather impetuously opened the
      parlor door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O daddy!&rdquo; she cried as she pulled a chair to his side. &ldquo;What are you
      talking about? I know it is about London; are you going to take me there
      with you? Say yes. Say it surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me a kiss and I will take both thee and thy mother there with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon, daddy? How soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As soon as possible. We must look after the poor and the land and then we
      can go with a good heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us talk it all over. Where are you going to stay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, my dear lass. I am talking to thy mother now and she is on a
      different level to thee. Run away to thy room and make up thy mind about
      thy new dress and the other little tricks thou wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such as a necklace and a full set of amber combs for my hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay! I hev no money for jewelry, while little childer and women all
      round us are wanting bread. Thou wouldn&rsquo;t suit it and it wouldn&rsquo;t be lucky
      to thee. Run away now, I&rsquo;ll talk all thou wants to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Verry well, dear daddy. Thy word is enough to build on. I can sit quiet
      and arrange my London plans, for a promise from thee is as sure as the
      thing itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the squire laughed and took a letter out of his pocketbook. &ldquo;It is
      good for a thousand pounds, honey,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that is a bit of
      security for my promise, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a penny&rsquo;s worth. Thy promise needs no security. It stands alone as it
      ought to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose as she spoke and the squire rose and opened the door for her and
      then stood and watched her mount the darkening stairway. At the first
      reach, she turned and bent her lovely face and form towards him. The
      joyful anticipations in her heart transfigured her. She was radiant. Her
      face shone and smiled; her white throat, and her white shoulders, and her
      exquisite arms, and her firm quick feet seemed to have some new sense
      given them. You would have said that her body thought and that her very
      voice had a caress in it as she bridged the space between them with a
      &ldquo;Thank you, dear, dear daddy! You are the very kindest father in all the
      world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thou art his pet and his darling!&rdquo; With these words he went back to
      his wife. &ldquo;She is justtip-on-top,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no girl I know like
      her. She sits in the sunlight of my heart. Why, Annie, she ought to make a
      better marriage than Jane, and Jane did middling well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would thou think Harry Bradley a good match?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t put him even in a passing thought with Katherine. Harry
      Bradley, indeed! I am fairly astonished at thee naming the middle class
      fellow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine thinks him all a man should be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will change her mind in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doubt that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou lets her hev opinions and ideas of her awn. Thou shouldn&rsquo;t do it.
      Jane will alter that. Jane will tell her how to rate men and women. Jane
      is varry clever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jane is no match for Katherine. Dost thou think Antony Annis will be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t doubt it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t try conclusions with her about Harry Bradley, and happen then
      thou may keep thy illusion. Katherine&rsquo;s fault is a grave one, though it
      often looks like a virtue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t see what thou means. Faults are faults, and virtues are virtues.
      I hev niver seen a fault of any kind in her, unless it be wanting more
      guineas than I can spare her just now, but that is the original sin o&rsquo; 
      women as far as I can make out. Whativer is this fault that can look like
      a virtue?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She overdoes everything. She says too little, or too much; she does too
      little, or too much; she gives too little, or too much. In everything she
      exceeds. If she likes anyone, she is unreasonable about them; if she
      dislikes them, she is unjust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t call that much of a fault&mdash;if thou knew anything about
      farming thou would make little of it. Thou would know that it is the
      richest land that hes the most weeds in its crop. The plow and the harrow
      will clear it of weeds and the experience of life will teach Katherine to
      be less generous with both her feelings and her opinions. Let her overdo,
      it is a fault that will cure itself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the meantime it makes her too positive and insisting. She thinks
      she is right and she wants others to be right. She is even a bit forceable&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I can tell thee that women as well as men need some force of
      character, if they mean to do anything with their lives. <i>Why-a!</i>
      Force is in daily life all that powder is to shot. If our weavers&rsquo; wives
      hed more force in their characters, they wouldn&rsquo;t watch their children
      dying of hunger upon their knees and their hearths, they would make their
      stubborn men go to any kind of a loom. They wouldn&rsquo;t be bothering
      themselves about any Bill in Parliament, they would be crying out for
      bread for their children. We must see about the women and children
      to-morrow or we shall not be ready for Faith Foster&rsquo;s visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, but we need not think of it to-night. I&rsquo;m heart weary,
      Antony. Nobody can give sympathy long unless they turn kind words into
      kind actions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then just call Katherine and order a bit of supper in. And I&rsquo;d like a
      tankard of home-brewed, and a slice or two of cold mutton. My word, but
      the mutton bred in our rich meadows is worth eating! Such a fine color, so
      tender and juicy and full of rich red gravy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think thou would be better without the tankard. Our ale is four years
      old, and tha knows what it is at that age. It will give thee a rattling
      headache. The cask on now is very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure it is. A man could look a lion in the face after a couple of
      glasses of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I advise thee to take a glass of water, with thy mutton to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ll hev a glass of sherry wine, and thou can be my butler.
      And tell Katherine not to talk about London to-night. I hevn&rsquo;t got my
      intentions ready. I&rsquo;d be making promises it would not be right to keep.
      Tha knows&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katherine had not yet been promoted to a seat at the late supper table,
      and only came to it when specially asked. So Madam found her ungowned, and
      with loosened hair, in a dressing-sacque of blue flannel. She was writing
      a letter to a school friend, but she understood her mother&rsquo;s visit and
      asked with a smile&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I to come to supper, mother? Oh, I am so glad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, dearie, do not speak of London, nor the poor children, nor the
      selfish weavers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not selfish, mother. They believe they are fighting for their rights. You
      know that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t know it. I doan&rsquo;t believe it. Their wives and children ought to
      be more to them than their awn way which is what they really want. Doan&rsquo;t
      say a word about them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will not. I am going to tell father about the Arkroyds, who owned Scar
      Top House so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father will like to hear anything good about Colonel Arkroyd. He is the
      last of a fine Yorkshire family. Who told thee anything about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Before I came to my room I went to give Polly some sugar I had in my
      pocket for her, and I met Britton, who had just come from the stable. He
      turned and went with me and he was full of the story and so I had to
      listen to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we will listen to it when thou comes down. Father is hungry,
      so don&rsquo;t keep him waiting, or he will be put out of his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will be down in five minutes, and father is never cross with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, when Madam went back to the parlor, a servant was bringing in the
      cold mutton and Madam had the bottle of sherry in her hand. A few minutes
      later Katherine had joined her parents, and they were sitting cozily round
      a small table, set in the very warmth and light of the hearthstone. Then
      Madam, fearing some unlucky word or allusion, said as quickly as possible&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever was it thou heard about Colonel Ark-royd, Katherine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay! Ay! Colonel Arkroyd! Who has anything to say about him?&rdquo; asked the
      squire. &ldquo;One of the finest men alive to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard a strange thing about his old house, an hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he sold Scar Top House, and went to live in Kendal. A man from
      Bradford bought it, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a man with a factory and six hundred looms, they say. Father, have
      you noticed how crowded our rookery is with the birds&rsquo; nests this spring?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t know that I hev noticed the number of the nests, but nobody can
      help hearing their noisy chattering all over Annis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the rookery at Scar Top?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I often hed a friendly threep with Ark-royd about it. He would
      insist, that his rookery hed the largest congregation. I let him think so&mdash;he&rsquo;s
      twenty years older than I am&mdash;and I did hear that the Bradford man
      had bought the place because of the rookery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he did. And now, father, every bird has left it. There was not one
      nest built there this spring. Not one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never heard the like. Whoever told thee such a story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole village knows it. One morning very early every rook in Scar Top
      went away. They went altogether, just before daybreak. They went to
      Saville Court and settled in a long row of elm trees in the home meadow.
      They are building there now and the Bradford man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give him his name. It is John Denby. He was born in Annis&mdash;in my
      manor&mdash;and he worked for the colonel, near twenty years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. John Denby and Colonel Arkroyd have quarreled about the birds,
      and there is likely to be a law suit over them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word! That will be a varry interesting quarrel. What could make
      birds act in such a queer way? I niver knew them to do such a thing
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, rooks are very aristocratic birds. Denby could not get a <i>caw</i>
      out of the whole flock. They would not notice Denby, and they used to talk
      to Arkroyd, whenever he came out of the house. Denby used to work for
      Colonel Arkroyd, and the rooks knew it. They did not consider him a
      gentleman, and they would not accept his hospitality.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is going a bit too far, Katherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! Old Britton told me so, and the Yorkshire bird does not live who
      has not told Britton all about itself. He said further, that rooks are
      very vain and particularly so about their feathers. He declared they would
      go far out of their way in order to face the wind and so prevent ruffling
      their feathers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rooks are at least a very human bird,&rdquo; said Madam; &ldquo;our rooks make quite
      a distinction between thee and myself. I can easily notice it. The male
      birds are in a flutter when thou walks through the rookery, they moderate
      their satisfaction when I pay them a call and it is the female birds who
      do the honors then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That reminds me, mother, that Britton told me rooks intermarried
      generation after generation, and that if a rook brought home a strange
      bride, he was forced to build in a tree the community selected, at some
      distance from the rookery. If he did not do this, his nest was
      relentlessly torn down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, my Joy, I am glad to learn so much from thee. How do the rooks
      treat thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With but moderate notice, father, unless I am at Britton&rsquo;s side. Then
      they &lsquo;caw&rsquo; respectfully, as I take my way through their colony. Britton
      taught me to lift my hat now and then, as father does.&rdquo; The squire
      laughed, and was a bit confused. &ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Britton hes been
      making up that story, though I vow, I would rayther take off my hat to
      gentlemanly rooks than to some humans I know; I would that! There is one
      thing I can tell thee about rooks, Britton seems to have forgot; they
      can&rsquo;t make a bit of sunshine for themselves. If t&rsquo; weather is rainy, no
      bird in the world is more miserable. They sit with puffed out feathers in
      uncontrollable melancholy, and they hevn&rsquo;t a caw for anybody. Yet I hev a
      great respect for rooks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I hev a great liking for rook pies,&rdquo; said Madam. &ldquo;There is not a pie
      in all the records of cookery, to come near it. <i>Par excellence</i> is
      its name. I shall miss my rook pies, if we go away this summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we shall have something better in their place, dear mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who can tell? In the meantime, sleep will be the best thing for all.
      To-morrow is a new day. Sleep will make us ready for it.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Seven. I can write as many as you wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hes written too many already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too many!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, tha must not forget, that this famine and distress is over all
      Yorkshire&mdash;over all England. Every town and village hes its awn sick
      and starving, and hes all it can do to look after them. Thy father told me
      last night he hed been giving to all the villages round us for a year back
      but until Mr. Foster told him yesterday he hed no idea that there was any
      serious trouble in Annis. Tha knows, dearie, that Yorkshire and Lancashire
      folk won&rsquo;t beg. No, not if they die for want of begging. The preacher
      found out their need first and he told father at once. Then Jonathan
      Hartley admitted they were all suffering and that something must be done
      to help. That is the reason for the meeting this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonathan hes been preparing for it for a week but he did not tell father
      until yesterday. I will give thee the names of four ladies that may assist
      in the way of sending food&mdash;there is Mrs. Benson, the doctor&rsquo;s wife&mdash;her
      husband is giving his time to the sick and if she hedn&rsquo;t a bit of money of
      her awn, Benson&rsquo;s family would be badly off, I fear. She may hev the heart
      to <i>do</i> as well as to pinch and suffer, but if she hesn&rsquo;t, we can&rsquo;t
      find her to blame. Send her an invitation. Send another to Mistress
      Craven. Colonel Craven is with his regiment somewhere, but she is wealthy,
      and for anything I know, good-hearted. Give her an opportunity. Lady
      Brierley can be counted on in some way or other and perhaps Mrs. Courtney.
      I can think of no others because everyone is likely to be looking for
      assistance just as we are. What day hev you named for the meeting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Monday. Is that too soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About a week too soon. None of these ladies will treat the invitation as
      a desirable one. They doubtless hev many engagements already made. Say,
      next Saturday. It is not reasonable to expect them to drop iverything else
      and hurry to Annis, to sew for the hungry and naked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mother! Little children! Who would not hurry to them with food and
      clothing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hes thou been with Faith Foster to see any children hungry and naked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother; but I do not need to <i>see</i> in order to <i>feel</i>. And
      I have certainly noticed how few children are on the street lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Katherine, girls of eighteen shouldn&rsquo;t need to <i>see</i> in order
      to feel. Thank God for thy fresh young feelings and keep them fresh as
      long as thou can. It will be a pity when thou begins to reason about them.
      Send letters to Mrs. Benson, Mrs. Craven, Lady Brierley, and Mrs.
      Courtney, and then we shall see what comes from them. After all, we are
      mere mortals!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you are friendly with all these four ladies?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good friends to come and go upon. By rights they ought to stand by Annis&mdash;but
      &lsquo;ought&rsquo; stands for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why <i>ought</i>, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father hes done ivery one o&rsquo; them a good turn of one kind or the
      other but it isn&rsquo;t his way to speak of the same. Now send off thy letters
      and let things slide until we see what road they are going to take. I&rsquo;m
      afraid I&rsquo;ll hev to put mysen about more than I like to in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That goes without saying but you don&rsquo;t mind it, do you, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your father took me on a sudden. I hedn&rsquo;t time to think before I
      spoke and when my heart gets busy, good-by to my head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Courtney has not been here for a long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is a good deal away but I saw her in London last year every now and
      then. She is a careless woman; she goes it blind about everything, and yet
      she wants to be at the bottom of all county affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, could we not do a little shopping today?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the fag end of the week? What are you talking about? Certainly not.
      Besides, thy father is worried about the meeting this afternoon. He says
      more may come of it than we can dream of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Katherine, it might end in a factory here, or it might end in the
      weavers heving to leave Annis and go elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cannot they get work of some other kind, in, or near by Annis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, tha surely knows, that a weaver hes to keep his fingers soft, and
      his hands supple. Hard manual work would spoil his hands forever for the
      loom, and our men are born weavers. They doan&rsquo;t fashion to any other work,
      and to be sure England hes to hev her weavers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, would it not be far better to have a factory? Lately, when I have
      taken a walk with father he always goes to the wold and looks all round
      considering just like a man who was wondering about a site for a building.
      It would be a good thing for us, mother, would it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems so, but father does not want it. He says it will turn Annis into
      a rough village, full of strangers, with bad ways, and also that it will
      spoil the whole country-side with its smoke and dirt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if it makes money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money isn&rsquo;t iverything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The want of it is dreadful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy father got a thousand pounds this morning. If he does not put most of
      it into a factory, he will put it into bread, which will be eaten to-day
      and wanted again to-morrow. That would make short work of a thousand
      pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you reminded father of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t need to. Father seems an easy-going man but he thinks of
      iverything; and when he <i>hes</i> to act no one strikes the iron quicker
      and harder. If thou saw him in London, if thou heard him in the House,
      brow-beating the Whigs and standing up for Peel and Wellington and others,
      thou would wonder however thou dared to tease, and contradict, and coax
      him in Annis. Thou would that! Now I am going to the lower summer house
      for an hour. Send away thy letters, and let me alone a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I saw father going down the garden. He is going to the summer
      house also; he intends to tell you, mother, what he is going to say
      to-night. He always reads, or recites his speeches to you. I have heard
      him sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou ought to be ashamed to speak of it! I am astonished at thy want
      of honor! If by chance, thou found out some reserved way of thy father it
      should have been held by thee as a sacred, inviolable secret. Not even to
      me, should thou have dared to speak of it. I am sorry, indeed, to hev to
      teach thee this point of childhood&rsquo;s honor. I thought it would be natural
      to the daughter of Antony and Annie Annis!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! Forgive me! I am ashamed and sorry and oh, do not, for my sake,
      tell father! My dear, dear father! You have made it look like mocking him&mdash;I
      never thought how shameful it could look&mdash;oh, I never thought about
      it! I never spoke of it before! I never did!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, see thou never again listens to what was not intended for
      thee to hear. It would be a pretty state of things, if thy father hed to
      go somewhere out of the way of listeners to get a bit of private talk with
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t be so cruel to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was thou trying to compliment me or was thou scorning a bit about thy
      father&rsquo;s ways? If thou thought I would feel complimented by being set
      above him that thought was as far wrong as it could possibly get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother! Mother! You will break my heart! You never before spoke this way
      to me&mdash;<i>Oh, dear! Oh, dear!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes Madam let her weep, then she bent over the crouching,
      sobbing girl, and said, &ldquo;There now! There now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so sorry! So sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dearie, sorrow is good for sin. It is the only thing sorrow is good
      for. Dry thy eyes, and we will niver name the miserable subject again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it really a sin, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hes thou forgotten the fifth commandment? That little laugh at thy
      father&rsquo;s saying his speeches to me first was more than a bit scornful. It
      was far enough from the commandment &lsquo;Honor thy father and thy mother.&rsquo; It
      wasn&rsquo;t honoring either of us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can never forgive myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay! nay! Give me a kiss and go and look after thy letters; also tell
      Yates dinner must be on the table at one o&rsquo;clock no matter what his watch
      says.&rdquo; Then Katherine walked silently away and Madam went to the lower
      summer house, and the dinner was on the table at one o&rsquo;clock. It was an
      exceedingly quiet meal, and immediately after it, the squire&rsquo;s horse was
      brought to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So thou art going to ride, Antony!&rdquo; said Mistress Annis, and the squire
      answered, &ldquo;Ay, I hev a purpose in riding, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art quite right,&rdquo; was the reply, for she thought she divined his
      purpose and the shadow of a smile passed between them. Then he looked at
      his watch, mounted his horse and rode swiftly away. His wife watched him
      out of sight and, as she turned into the house, she told herself with a
      proud and happy smile, &ldquo;He is the best and the handsomest man in the West
      Riding, and the horse suits him! He rides to perfection! God bless him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a point with the squire to be rigidly punctual. He was never either
      too soon, or too late. He knew that one fault was as bad as the other,
      though he considered the early mistake as the worst. It began to strike
      two as he reached the door of the Methodist Chapel, and saw Jonathan
      Hartley waiting there for him; and they walked at once to a rude platform
      that had been prepared for the speakers. There were several gentlemen
      standing there in a group, and the Chapel was crowded with anxious
      hungry-looking men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time that Squire Annis had ever stepped inside a
      Methodist Chapel. The thought was like the crack of a whip in his
      conscience but at that moment he would not listen to any claim or reproof;
      for either through liking or disliking, he was sensitive at once to
      Bradley&rsquo;s tall, burly predominance; and could not have said, whether it
      was pleasant or unpleasant to him. However, the moment he appeared, there
      was loud handclapping, and cries of &ldquo;Squire Annis! Squire Annis! Put him
      in the chair! He&rsquo;s our man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then into the squire&rsquo;s heart his good angel put a good thought, and he
      walked to the front of the platform and said, &ldquo;My men, and my friends,
      I&rsquo;ll do something better for you. I&rsquo;ll put the Reverend Samuel Foster in
      the chair. God&rsquo;s servant stands above all others, and Mr. Foster knows all
      about your poverty and affliction. I am a bit ashamed to say, I do not.&rdquo;
       This personal accusation was cut short by cries of &ldquo;No! No! No! Thou hes
      done a great deal,&rdquo; and then a cheer, that had in it all the Yorkshire
      spirit, though not its strength. The men were actually weak with hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Foster took the chair to which the squire led him without any
      affectations of demur, and he was gladly welcomed. Indeed there were few
      things that would have pleased the audience more. They were nearly all
      Methodists, and their preacher alone had searched out their misery, and
      helped them to bear it with patience and with hope. He now stretched out
      his hands to them and said&mdash;&ldquo;Friends, just give us four lines, and we
      will go at once to business&rdquo;; and in a sweet, ringing voice, he began
      Newman&rsquo;s exquisite hymn&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Leave God to order all thy ways,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And hope in Him whate&rsquo;er betide,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Thoul&rsquo;t find Him in the evil days,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      An all sufficient Strength and Guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The words came fresh and wet with tears from every heart, and it was a
      five minutes&rsquo; interlude of that complete surrender, which God loves and
      accepts.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a moment of intense silence, the preacher said, &ldquo;We are met to-day
      to try and find out if hand-loom weaving must go, or if both hand-loom
      weaving and power-loom weaving have a chance for the weaver in them. There
      are many hand-loom weavers here present. They know all its good points and
      all points wherein it fails but they do not know either the good or bad
      points of power-loom weaving, and Mr. John Thomas Bradley has come to tell
      you something about this tremendous rival of your household loom. I will
      now introduce Mr. John.&rdquo; He got no further in his introduction, for
      Bradley stepped forward, and with a buoyant good-nature said, &ldquo;No need,
      sir, of any fine mastering or mistering between the Annis lads and mysen.
      We hev thrashed each ither at football, and chated each ither in all kinds
      of swapping odds too often, to hev forgotten what names were given us at
      our christening. There&rsquo;s Israel Swale, he hes a bigger mill than I hev
      now-a-days, but he&rsquo;s owing me three pence half-penny and eleven marbles,
      yet whenever I ask him for my brass and my marbles he says&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll pay
      thee, John Thomas, when we play our next game.&rsquo; Now listen, lads, next
      Whitsunday holidays I&rsquo;ll ask him to come and see me, and I&rsquo;ll propose
      before a house full of company&mdash;and all ready for a bit of fun&mdash;that
      we hev our game of marbles in the bowling alley, and I&rsquo;ll get Jonathan
      Hartley to give you all an invitation to come and see fair play between
      us. Will you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Noisy laughing acceptances followed and one big Guisely weaver said, &ldquo;He&rsquo;d
      come too, and see that Israel played a straight game for once in his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m obliged to thee, Guisely,&rdquo; answered Bradley, &ldquo;I hope thou&rsquo;lt come.
      Now then, lads, I hev to speak to you about business, and if you think
      what I say is right, go and do what I say, do it boldly; and if you aren&rsquo;t
      sure, then let it alone:&mdash;till you are driven to it. I am told that
      varry few of the men here present iver saw a power loom. And yet you
      mostly think ill o&rsquo; it. That isn&rsquo;t a bit Yorkshire. You treat a man as you
      find him, you ought to do the same to a machine, that is almost a man in
      intelligence&mdash;that is the most perfect bit of beauty and contrivance
      that man iver made since man himsen was fitted wi&rsquo; fingers and thumbs by
      the Great Machinist of heaven and earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it fashioned like, Bradley?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is an exceedingly compact machine and takes up little room. It is
      easily worked and it performs every weaving operation with neatness and
      perfection. It makes one hundred and seventy picks a minute or six pieces
      of goods in a week&mdash;you know it was full work and hard work to make
      one piece a week with the home loom, even for a strong man. It is made
      mostly of shining metal, and it is a perfect darling. <i>Why-a!</i> the
      lads and lassies in Bradley mill call their looms after their sweethearts,
      or husbands, or wives, and I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if they said many a sweet or
      snappy word to the looms that would niver be ventured on with the real
      Bessie or the real Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think of your old cumbersome wooden looms, so hard and heavy and dreary
      to work, that it wasn&rsquo;t fit or right to put a woman down to one. Then go
      and try a power loom, and when you hev done a day&rsquo;s work on it, praise God
      and be thankful! I tell you God saw the millions coming whom Yorkshire and
      Lancashire would hev to clothe, and He gave His servant the grave, gentle,
      middle-aged preacher Edmund Cartwright, the model of a loom fit for God&rsquo;s
      working men and women to use. I tell you men the power loom is one of
      God&rsquo;s latest Gospels. We are spelling yet, with some difficulty, its first
      good news, but the whole world will yet thank God for the power loom!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the preacher on the platform said a fervent &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; But the
      audience was not yet sure enough for what they were to thank God, and the
      few echoes to the preacher&rsquo;s invitation were strangely uncertain for a
      Yorkshire congregation. A few of the Annis weavers compromised on a solemn
      &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; All, however, noticed that the squire remained silent, and they
      were &ldquo;not going&rdquo;&mdash;as Lot Clarke said afterwards&mdash;&ldquo;to push
      themsens before t&rsquo; squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Jonathan Hartley stepped into the interval, and addressing Bradley
      said, &ldquo;Tha calls this wonderful loom a power-loom. I&rsquo;ll warrant the power
      comes from a steam engine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right, Jonathan. I wish tha could see the wonderful engine at
      Dalby&rsquo;s Mill in Pine Hollow. The marvelous creature stands in its big
      stone stable like a huge image of Destiny. It is never still, but never
      restless, nothing rough; calm and steady like the waves of the full sea at
      Scarboro&rsquo;. It is the nervous center, the life, I might say, of all going
      on in that big building above it. It moves all the machinery, it gives
      life to the devil, * and speeds every shuttle in every loom.&rdquo;
     </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * The devil, a machine containing a revolving cylinder armed
     with knives or spikes for tearing, cutting, or opening raw
     materials.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t looms and engines we are worrying about, Bradley,&rdquo; said a man
      pallid and fretful with hunger. &ldquo;It is flesh and blood, that can&rsquo;t stand
      hunger much longer. It&rsquo;s our lile lads and lasses, and the babies at the
      mother&rsquo;s breast, where there isn&rsquo;t a drop o&rsquo; milk for their thin, white
      lips! O God! And you talk o&rsquo; looms and engines&rdquo;&mdash;and the man sat down
      with a sob, unable to say another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Annis could hardly sit still, but the preacher looked at him and he
      obeyed the silent wish, as in the meantime Jonathan Hartley had asked
      Bradley a question, to partly answer the request made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you want to know about the workers, all their rooms are large and
      cheerful, with plenty of fresh air in them. The weaving rooms are as light
      and airy as a bird cage. The looms are mostly managed by women, from
      seventeen to thirty, wi&rsquo; a sprinkling o&rsquo; married men and women. A solid
      trade principle governs t&rsquo; weaving room&mdash;so much work, for so much
      money&mdash;but I hev girls of eighteen in my mill, who are fit and able
      to thread the shuttles, and manage two looms, keeping up the pieces to
      mark, without oversight or help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here he was interrupted by a man with long hair parted in the middle of
      the forehead, and dressed in a suit of fashionable cut, but cheap
      tailoring. &ldquo;I hev come to this meeting,&rdquo; he cried out, &ldquo;to ask your
      parliamentary representative if he intends to vote for the Reform Bill,
      and to urge the better education of the lower classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who bid thee come to this meeting?&rdquo; asked Jonathan Hartley. &ldquo;Thou has no
      business here. Not thou. And we weren&rsquo;t born in Yorkshire to be fooled by
      thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told by friends of the people, that your member would likely vote
      against Reform.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put him out! Put him out!&rdquo; resounded from every quarter of the building,
      and for the first time since the meeting opened, there was a touch of
      enthusiasm. Then the squire stepped with great dignity to the front of the
      platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Young men,&rdquo; he said with an air of reproof, &ldquo;this is not a political
      meeting. It is not even a public meeting. It is a gathering of friends to
      consider how best to relieve the poverty and idleness for which our
      weavers are not to blame&mdash;and we do not wish to be interrupted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The blame is all wi&rsquo; you rich landowners,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;ivery one o&rsquo; you
      stand by a government that robs the poor man and protects the rich. I am a
      representative of the Bradford Socialists.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git out! Git out! Will tha? If tha doesn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll fling thee out like any
      other rubbish;&rdquo; and as the man made no attempt to obey the command given,
      Hartley took him by the shoulder, and in spite of his protestations&mdash;received
      with general jeers and contempt&mdash;put him outside the chapel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Annis heartily approved the word, act and manner of Hartley&rsquo;s
      little speech. The temperature of his blood rose to fighting heat, and he
      wanted to shout with the men in the body of the chapel. Yet his
      countenance was calm and placid, for Antony Annis was <i>Master at Home</i>,
      and could instantly silence or subdue whatever his Inner Man prompted that
      was improper or inconvenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought, however, that it was now a fit time-for him to withdraw, and
      he was going to say the few words he had so well considered, when a very
      old man rose, and leaning on his staff, called out, &ldquo;Squire Annis, my
      friend, I want thee to let me speak five minutes. It will varry likely be
      t&rsquo; last time I&rsquo;ll hev the chance to say a word to so many lads altogether
      in this life.&rdquo; And the squire smiled pleasantly as he replied, &ldquo;Speak,
      Matthew, we shall all be glad to listen to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ill be ninety-five years old next month, Squire, and I hev been busy wi&rsquo; 
      spinning and weaving eighty-eight o&rsquo; them. I was winding bobbins when I
      was seven years old, and I was carding, or combing, or working among wool
      until I was twenty. Then I got married, and bought from t&rsquo; squire, on easy
      terms, my cottage and garden plot, and I kept a pig and some chickens, and
      a hutch full o&rsquo; rabbits, which I fed on the waste vegetables from my
      garden. I also had three or four bee skeps, that gave us honey for our
      bread, with a few pounds over to sell; t&rsquo; squire allays bought the
      overbit, and so I was well paid for a pretty bed of flowers round about
      the house. I was early at my loom, but when I was tired I went into my
      garden, and I smoked a pipe and talked to the bees, who knew me well
      enough, ivery one o&rsquo; them. If it was raining, I went into t&rsquo; kitchen, and
      smoked and hed a chat wi&rsquo; Polly about our awn concerns. I hev had four
      handsome lassies, and four good, steady lads. Two o&rsquo; the lads went to
      America, to a place called Lowell, but they are now well-to-do men, wi&rsquo; 
      big families. My daughters live near me, and they keep my cottage as
      bright as their mother kept it for over fifty years. I worked more or less
      till I was ninety years old, and then Squire Annis persuaded me to stop my
      loom, and just potter about among my bees and flowers. Now then, lads,
      thousands hev done for years and years as much, even more than I hev done
      and I hev never met but varry few Home-loom weavers who were dissatisfied.
      They all o&rsquo; them made their awn hours and if there was a good race
      anywhere near-by they shut off and went to it. Then they did extra work
      the next day to put their &lsquo;piece&rsquo; straight for Saturday. If their &lsquo;piece&rsquo; 
      was right, the rest was nobody&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matthew,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;for many a year you seldom missed a
      race.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if t&rsquo; horses were good, and well matched. I knew the names then of a&rsquo; 
      the racers that wer&rsquo; worth going to see. I love a fine horse yet. I do
      that! And the Yorkshire roar when the victor came to mark! You could hear
      it a mile away! O squire, I can hear it yet!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, lads, I hev hed a happy, busy life, and I hev been a good Methodist
      iver sin&rsquo; I was converted, when I was twelve years old. And I bear
      testimony this day to the goodness and the faithfulness of God. He hes
      niver broken a promise He made me. Niver one!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thousands of Home-loom spinners can live, and have lived, as I did and
      they know all about t&rsquo; life. I know nothing about power-loom weaving. I
      dare say a man can make good or bad o&rsquo; it, just as he feels inclined; but
      I will say, it brings men down to a level God Almighty niver intended. It
      is like this&mdash;when a man works in his awn home, and makes his awn
      hours, all the world, if he be good and honest, calls him <i>A Man</i>;
      when he works in a factory he&rsquo;s nobbut &lsquo;<i>one o&rsquo; the hands</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At these words Matthew sat down amid a little subdued inexpressible
      mixture of tense feeling and the squire said&mdash;&ldquo;In three weeks or
      less, men, I am going to London, and I give you my word, that I shall
      always be found on the side of Reform and Free Trade. When I return you
      will surely have made up your minds and formed some sort of decision; then
      I will try and forward your plans to my last shilling.&rdquo; With these words
      he bowed to the gentlemen on the platform, and the audience before him,
      and went rapidly away. His servant was at the Chapel door with his horse;
      he sprang into the saddle, and before anyone could interrupt his exit, he
      was beyond detention.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great disturbance was in his soul. He could not define it. The condition
      of his people, the changing character of his workers and weavers, the very
      village seemed altered, and then the presence of Bradley! He had found it
      impossible to satisfy both his offense with the man and his still vital
      affection for him. He had often told himself that &ldquo;Bradley was dead and
      buried as far as he was concerned&rdquo;; but some affections are buried alive,
      and have a distressing habit of being restless in their coffins. It was
      with the feeling of a fugitive flying for a place of rest that he went
      home. But, oh, how refreshing was his wife&rsquo;s welcome! What comfort in her
      happy smile! What music in her tender words! He leaped to the ground like
      a young man and, clasping her hand, went gratefully with her to his own
      fireside.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">K</span>ATHERINE&rsquo;S letters
      bore little fruit. Lady Brierley sent fifty pounds to buy food, but said
      &ldquo;she was going to Bourmouth for the spring months, being unable to bear
      the winds of the Yorkshire wolds at that time.&rdquo; Mrs. Craven and Mrs.
      Courtney were on their way to London, and Mrs. Benson said her own large
      family required every hour of her time, especially as she was now only
      able to keep one servant. So the village troubles were confided to the
      charge of Faith Foster and her father. The squire put a liberal sum of
      money with the preacher, and its application was left entirely to his
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Annis now feel himself able to delay his journey until April. He
      was urged constantly by the leaders of the Reform Bill to hasten his visit
      to the House. Letters from Lord Russell, Sir James Grahame and Lord Grey
      told him that among the landlords of the West Riding his example would
      have a great influence, and that at this &ldquo;important crisis they looked
      with anxiety, yet certainty, for his support.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not withhold it. After his enlightenment by Mr. Foster, he hardly
      needed any further appeal. His heart and his conscience gave him no rest,
      and in ten days he had made suitable arrangements, both for the care of
      his estate, and the relief of the village. In this business he had been
      greatly hurried and pressed, and the Hall was also full of unrest and
      confusion, for all Madam&rsquo;s domestic treasures were to pack away and to put
      in strict and competent care. For, then, there really were women who
      enjoyed household rackets and homes turned up and over from top to bottom.
      It was their relief from the hysteria of monotony and the temper that
      usually attends monotony. They knew nothing of the constant changes and
      pleasures of the women of today&mdash;of little chatty lunches and theater
      parties; of their endless societies and games, and clubs of every
      description; of fantastic dressing and undressing from every age and
      nation; beside the appropriation of all the habits and pursuits and
      pleasures of men that seemed good in their eyes, or their imaginations.
    </p>
    <p>
      So to the woman of one hundred years ago&mdash;and of much less time&mdash;a
      thorough house-cleaning, or a putting away of things for a visit or a
      journey was an exciting event. There was even a kind of pleasure in the
      discomfort and disorder it caused. The unhappy looks of the men of the
      house were rather agreeable to them. For a few days they had legitimate
      authority to make everyone miserable, and in doing so experienced a very
      actual nervous relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam Annis was in some measure influenced by similar conditions, for it
      takes a strong and powerfully constituted woman to resist the spirit and
      influence of the time and locality in which she lives. So the Hall was
      full of unrest, and the peaceful routine of life was all broken up.
      Ladies&rsquo; hide-covered trunks&mdash;such little baby trunks to those of the
      present day&mdash;and leather bags and portmanteaus littered the halls;
      and the very furniture had the neglected plaintive look of whatever is to
      be left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, on the twenty-third of March, all was ready for the
      journey, and the squire was impatient to begin it. He was also continually
      worrying about his son. &ldquo;Whereiver is Dick, I wonder? He ought to be here
      helping us, ought he not, mother?&rdquo; he asked Madam reproachfully, as if he
      held her responsible for Dick&rsquo;s absence and Madam answered sharply&mdash;&ldquo;Indeed,
      Antony, thou ought to know best. Thou told Dick to stay in London and
      watch the ways of that wearisome Reform Bill and send thee daily word
      about its carryings on. The lad can&rsquo;t be in two places at once, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hed forgotten mysen, Annie. How near art thou and Katherine ready to
      start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine and I are now waiting on your will and readiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, Annie, if ta hes got to thy London English already, I&rsquo;ll be
      quiet, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t like thee to be unjust to Dick. He is doing, and doing well,
      just what thou told him to do. I should think thou couldn&rsquo;t ask more than
      that&mdash;if thou was in thy right mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick is the best lad in Yorkshire, he is all that! Doan&rsquo;t thee care if I
      seem a bit cross, Annie. I&rsquo;ve been that worrited all morning as niver was.
      Doan&rsquo;t mind it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t, not in the least, Antony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, can thou start to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can start, with an hour&rsquo;s notice, any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be too good, Annie. I&rsquo;m not worth it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art worth all I can do for thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varry good, dearie! Then we&rsquo;ll start at seven to-morrow morning. We will
      drive to Leeds, and then tak t&rsquo; mail-coach for London there. If t&rsquo; roads
      don&rsquo;t happen to be varry bad we may hev time enough in Leeds to go to the
      Queen&rsquo;s Hotel and hev a plate o&rsquo; soup and a chop. I hev a bit o&rsquo; business
      at the bank there but it won&rsquo;t keep me ten minutes. I hope we may hev a
      fairish journey, but the preacher tells me the whole country is in a varry
      alarming condition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony, I am a little tired of the preacher&rsquo;s alarm bell. He is always
      prophesying evil. Doan&rsquo;t thee let him get too much influence over thee.
      Before thou knows what thou art doing thou wilt be going to a class
      meeting. What does the curate say? He has been fifty miles south, if not
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He told me the roads were full of hungry, angry men, who were varry
      disrespectful to any of the Quality they met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Katherine entered the room. &ldquo;Mother dear,&rdquo; she said in an excited
      voice, &ldquo;mother dear! My new traveling dress came home a little while ago,
      and I have put it on, to let you admire it. Is it not pretty? Is it not
      stylish? Is it not everything a girl would like? O Daddy! I didn&rsquo;t see
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t expect thee to see me when tha hed a new dress on. I&rsquo;ll tell
      thee, howiver, I doan&rsquo;t like it as well as I liked thy last suit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The little shepherd plaid? Oh, that has become quite common! This is the
      thing now. What do you say, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is all right. Put it on in the morning. We leave at seven
      o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, delightful! I am so glad! Life is all in a mess here and I hate a
      tossed-up house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the Reverend Mr. Yates entered. He had called to bid the
      squire and his family good-bye, but the ladies quickly left the room. They
      knew some apology was due the curate for placing the money intended for
      relieving the suffering in the village in the preacher&rsquo;s care, and at his
      disposal. But the curate was reasonable, and readily acknowledged that
      &ldquo;nearly all needing help were members of Mr. Foster&rsquo;s church, and would
      naturally take relief better from him than from a stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The journey as far as Leeds was a very sad one, for the squire stopped
      frequently to speak to groups of despairing, desperate men and women:&mdash;&ldquo;Hev
      courage, friends!&rdquo; he said cheerfully to a gathering of about forty or
      more on the Green of a large village, only fourteen miles south of Annis.
      &ldquo;Hev courage a little longer! I am Antony Annis, and I am on my way to
      London, with many more gentlemen, to see that the Reform Bill goes through
      the Lords, this time. If it does not then it will be the duty of
      Englishmen to know the reason why. God knows you hev borne up bravely. Try
      it a bit longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire,&rdquo; said a big fellow, white with hunger, &ldquo;Squire, I hevn&rsquo;t touched
      food of any kind for forty hours. You count hours when you are hungry,
      squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all o&rsquo; us,&rdquo; said his companion, &ldquo;faint and clemmed. We hevn&rsquo;t
      strength to be men any longer. Look at me! I&rsquo;m wanting to cry like a
      bairn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to fight, squire,&rdquo; added a man standing near by; &ldquo;I hev a bit
      o&rsquo; manhood yet, and I&rsquo;d fight for my rights, I would that!&mdash;if I
      nobbnd hed a slice or two o&rsquo; bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the same time a young woman, little more than a child, came tottering
      forward, and stood at the side of Mistress Annis. She had a little baby in
      her arms, she did not speak, she only looked in the elder woman&rsquo;s face
      then cast her eyes down upon the child. It was tugging at an empty breast
      with little sharp cries of hungry impatience. Then she said, &ldquo;I hev no
      milk for him! The lile lad is sucking my blood!&rdquo; Her voice was weak and
      trembling, but she had no tears left.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam covered her face, she was weeping, and the next moment Katherine
      emptied her mother&rsquo;s purse into the starving woman&rsquo;s hand. She took it
      with a great cry, lifting her face to heaven&mdash;&ldquo;Oh God, it is money!
      Oh God, it is milk and bread!&rdquo; Then looking at Katherine she said, &ldquo;Thou
      hes saved two lives. God sent thee to do it&rdquo;&mdash;and with the words, she
      found a sudden strength to run with her child to a shop across the street,
      where bread and milk were sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s little Dinas Sykes,&rdquo; said a man whose voice was weak with hunger.
      &ldquo;Eh! but I&rsquo;m glad, God hes hed mercy on her!&rdquo; and all watched Dinas
      running for milk and bread with a grateful sympathy. The squire was
      profoundly touched, his heart melted within him, and he said to the little
      company with the voice of a companion, not of a master, &ldquo;Men, how many of
      you are present?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About forty-four men&mdash;and a few half grown lads. They need food
      worse than men do&mdash;they suffer more&mdash;poor lile fellows!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you all hev women at home? Wives and daughters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, squire, and mothers, too! Old and gray and hungry&mdash;some varry
      patient, and just dying on their feet, some so weak they are crying like
      t&rsquo; childer of two or four years old. My God! Squire, t&rsquo; men&rsquo;s suffering
      isn&rsquo;t worth counting, against that of t&rsquo; women and children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friends, I hev no words to put against your suffering and a ten pound
      note will be better than all the words I could give you. It will at least
      get all of you a loaf of bread and a bit of beef and a mug of ale. Who
      shall I give it to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ben Shuttleworth,&rdquo; was the unanimous answer, and Ben stepped forward. He
      was a noble-looking old man just a little crippled by long usage of the
      hand loom. &ldquo;Squire Annis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gladly take the gift God hes
      sent us by thy hands and I&rsquo;ll divide it equally, penny for penny, and may
      God bless thee and prosper thy journey! We&rsquo;re none of us men used to
      saying &lsquo;thank&rsquo;ee&rsquo; to any man but we say it to thee. Yes, we say it to
      thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Kindred scenes occurred in every village and they did not reach Leeds in
      time for the mail coach they intended to take. The squire was not troubled
      at the delay. He said, &ldquo;he hed a bit of his awn business to look after,
      and he was sure Katherine hed forgotten one or two varry necessary things,
      that she could buy in Leeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katherine acknowledged that she had forgotten her thimble and her hand
      glass, and said she had &ldquo;been worrying about her back hair, which she
      could not dress without one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Madam was tired and glad to rest. &ldquo;But Antony,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Dick will meet
      this coach and when we do not come by it, he will have wonders and worries
      about us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he! Dick knows something about women, and also, I told him we might
      sleep a night or two at some town on the way, if you were tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next day they began the journey again, half-purposing to stop and rest
      at some half-way town. The squire said Dick understood them. He would be
      on hand if they loitered a week. And Madam was satisfied; she thought it
      likely Dick had instructions fitting his father&rsquo;s uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet though the coach prevented actual contact with the miserable famine
      sufferers, it could not prevent them witnessing the silent misery sitting
      on every door step, and looking with such longing eyes for help from God
      or man. Upon the whole it was a journey to break a pitiful heart, and the
      squire and his family were glad when the coach drew up with the rattle of
      wheels and the blowing of the guard&rsquo;s horn at its old stand of Charing
      Cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magic of London was already around them, and the first face they saw
      was the handsome beaming face of Dick Annis. He nodded and smiled to his
      father, who was sitting&mdash;where he had sat most of the journey&mdash;at
      the side of the driver. Dick would have liked to help him to the street,
      but he knew that his father needed no help and would likely be vexed at
      any offer of it, but Dick&rsquo;s mother and sister came out of the coach in his
      arms, and the lad kissed them and called them all the fond names he could
      think of. Noticing at the same time his father&rsquo;s clever descent, he put
      out his left hand to him, for he had his mother guarded with his right
      arm. &ldquo;You did that jump, dad, better than I could have done it. Are you
      tired?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all tired to death, Dick. Hev you a cab here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, I have! Your rooms at the Clarendon are in order, and there
      will be a good dinner waiting when you are ready for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In something less than an hour they were all ready for a good dinner;
      their faces had been washed, Katherine&rsquo;s hair smoothed and Madam&rsquo;s cap
      properly adjusted. The squire was standing on the hearthrug in high
      spirits. The sight of his son, the touch of the town, the pleasant light
      and comfort of his surroundings, the prospect of dinner, made him forget
      for a few minutes the suffering he had passed through, until his son
      asked, &ldquo;And did you have a pleasant journey, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A journey, Dick, to break a man&rsquo;s heart. It hes turned me from a Tory
      into a Radical. This government must feed the people or&mdash;we will kick
      them back&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear father, we will talk of that subject by ourselves. It isn&rsquo;t fit for
      two tired women, now is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe not; but I hev seen and I hev heard these last two or three days,
      Dick, what I can niver forget. Things hev got to be altered. They hev
      that, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will talk that over after mother and Kitty have gone to sleep. We
      won&rsquo;t worry them to-night. I have ordered mother&rsquo;s favorite Cabinet
      pudding for her, and some raspberry cream for Kitty. It wouldn&rsquo;t be right
      to talk of unhappy things with good things in our mouths, now would it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are coming. I can hear Kitty&rsquo;s laugh, when I can hear nothing else.
      Ring the bell, Dick, we can hev dinner now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were a few pleasant moments spent in choosing their seats, and as
      soon as they were taken, a dish of those small delicious oysters for which
      England has been famous since the days of the Roman Emperors were placed
      before them. &ldquo;I had some scalloped for mother and Kitty,&rdquo; Dick said. &ldquo;Men
      can eat them raw, alive if they choose, but women&mdash;Oh no! It isn&rsquo;t
      womanlike! Mother and Kitty wouldn&rsquo;t do it! Not they!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what else hes ta got for us, Dick?&rdquo; asked the squire. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m mortal
      hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The last word shocked him anew. He wished he had not said it. What made
      him do it? Hungry! He had never been really hungry in all his life; and
      those pallid men and women, with that look of suffering on their faces,
      and in their dry, anxious eyes, how could he ever forget them?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was suddenly silent, and Katherine said: &ldquo;Father is tired. He would
      drive so much. I wonder the coachman let him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father paid for the privilege of doing the driver&rsquo;s work for him. I have
      no doubt of that, my dears,&rdquo; said Madam. &ldquo;Well, Dick, when did you see
      Jane?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you not observe, mother, that I am in evening dress? Jane has a dance
      and supper to-night. Members from the government side will be dropping in
      there after midnight, for refreshment. Both Houses are in all-night
      sittings now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How does Leyland vote?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is tremendously royal and loyal. You will have to mind your p&rsquo;s and
      q&rsquo;s with him now, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I! I take my awn way. Leyland&rsquo;s way and mine are far apart. How is
      your Aunt Josepha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is all right. She is never anything else but all right. Certainly she
      is vexed that Katherine is not to stay with her. Jane has been making a
      little brag about it, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Katherine could stay part of the time with her,&rdquo; said the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had better be with Jane. Aunt will ask O&rsquo;Connell to her dinners, and
      others whom Katherine would not like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does she do it? She knows better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suspect we all know better than we do. She says, &lsquo;O&rsquo;Connell keeps the
      dinner table lively.&rsquo; So he does. The men quarrel all the time they eat
      and the women really admire them for it. They say &lsquo;<i>Oh!</i>&rsquo; at a very
      strong word, but they would love to see them really fighting. Women affect
      tenderness and fearfulness; they are actually cruel creatures. Aunt says,
      &lsquo;that was what her dear departed told her, and she had no doubt he had had
      experiences.&rsquo; Jane sent her love to all of you, and she purposes coming
      for Katherine about two o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Madam, in a rather indifferent way, &ldquo;Katherine and I can find
      plenty to do, and to see, in London. Jane told me recently, she had a new
      carriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One of the finest turn-outs Long Acre could offer her. The team is good
      also. Leyland is a judge of horses, and he has chosen a new livery with
      his new honors&mdash;gray with silver trimmings. It looks handsome and
      stylish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And will spoil quickly,&rdquo; said Madam. &ldquo;Jane asked me about the livery, and
      I told her to avoid light colors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you should have told her to choose light colors. Jane lives and
      votes with the opposition.&rdquo; In pleasant domestic conversation the hours
      slipped happily away, but after the ladies had retired, Dick did not stay
      long. The squire was really weary, though he &ldquo;<i>pooh-poohed</i>&rdquo; the
      idea. &ldquo;A drive from Leeds to London, with a rest between, what is that to
      tire a man?&rdquo; he asked, adding, &ldquo;I hev trotted a Norfolk cob the distance
      easy in less time, and I could do it again, if I wanted to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course you could, father. Oh, I wish to ask you if you know anything
      of the M.P. from Appleby?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you say about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He made a masterly speech last session, in favor of Peel&rsquo;s ministry. I
      liked it then. I hevn&rsquo;t one good word for it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a very fine looking man. I suppose he is wealthy. He lives in good
      style here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about his money. The De Burgs are a fine family&mdash;among
      the oldest in England&mdash;Cumberland, I believe, down Furness way. Why
      art thou bothering thysen about him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is one of Jane&rsquo;s favorites. He goes to Ley-land&rsquo;s house a deal. I was
      thinking of Katherine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about Katherine? What about Katherine?&rdquo; the squire asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know Katherine is beautiful, and this De Burg is very handsome&mdash;in
      his way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What way?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the De Burgs are of Norman descent and Stephen De Burg shows it. He
      has indeed the large, gray eyes of our own North Country, but his hair is
      black&mdash;very black&mdash;and his complexion is swarthy. However, he is
      tall and well-built, and remarkably graceful in speech and action&mdash;quite
      the young man to steal a girl&rsquo;s heart away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hes he stolen any girl&rsquo;s heart from thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not he, indeed! I am Annis enough to keep what I win; but I was wondering
      if our little Kitty was a match for Stephen De Burg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha needn&rsquo;t worry thysen about Kitty Annis. I&rsquo;ll warrant her a match for
      any man. Her mother says she hes a fancy for Harry Bradley, but I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry is a fine fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody said he wasn&rsquo;t a fine fellow, and there is not any need for thee
      to interrupt thy father in order to tell him that! Harry Bradley, indeed!
      I wouldn&rsquo;t spoil any plan of De Burg&rsquo;s to please or help Harry Bradley!
      Not I! Now I hope tha understands that! To-morrow thou can tell me about
      thy last goddess, and if she be worthy to sit after thy mother in Annis
      Court, I&rsquo;ll help thee to get wedded to her gladly. For I&rsquo;m getting
      anxious, Dick, about my grandsons and their sisters. I&rsquo;d like to see them
      that are to come after me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dick went away with a laugh, but as the father and son stood a moment
      hand-clasped, their resemblance was fitting and beautiful; and no one
      noticing this fact could wonder at the Englishman&rsquo;s intense affection and
      anxious care for the preservation of his family type.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire then put out the candles and covered the fire just as he would
      have done at Annis and while he did so he pondered what Dick had told him
      and resolved to say nothing at all about it. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;I
      shall get Katherine&rsquo;s real opinions about De Burg. Women are so queer,
      they won&rsquo;t iver tell you the truth about men unless they believe you don&rsquo;t
      care what they think:&mdash;and I won&rsquo;t tell Annie either. Annie would
      take to warning and watching, and, for anything I know, advising her to be
      faithful and true to her first love. Such simplicity! Such nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he went to his room and found Mistress Annis sitting with her feet on
      the fender, sipping a glass of wine negus, and as she dipped her little
      strips of dry toast into it, she said, &ldquo;I am so glad to see thee, Antony.
      I am too excited to sleep and I wanted a few words with thee and thee
      only. For three days I hev missed our quiet talks with each other. I heard
      Dick laughing; what about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him I was getting varry anxious about my grandsons, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then both laughed and the squire stooped and kissed his wife and in that
      moment he sat down by her side and frankly told her all he had heard about
      De Burg. They talked about it for half-an-hour and then the squire went
      calmly off to sleep without one qualm of conscience for his broken
      resolution. In fact he assured himself that &ldquo;he had done right.
      Katherine&rsquo;s mother was Katherine&rsquo;s proper guardian and he was only doing
      his duty in giving her points that might help her to do her duty.&rdquo; That
      reflection was a comfortable one on which to sleep and he took all the
      rest it gave him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madam lay awake worrying about Katherine&rsquo;s wardrobe. After hearing of her
      sister&rsquo;s growing social importance she felt that it should have been
      attended to before they left Yorkshire. For in those days there were no
      such things as ready-made suits, and any dress or costume lacking had to
      be selected from the web, the goods bought, the dressmaker interviewed,
      and after several other visits for the purpose of &ldquo;trying-on&rdquo; the gown
      might be ready for use. These things troubled Madam. Katherine felt more
      confidence in her present belongings. &ldquo;I have half a dozen white frocks
      with me, mother,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and nothing could be prettier or richer than
      my two Dacca muslins. The goods are fine as spider webs, the embroidery on
      them is nearly priceless, and they are becoming every year more and more
      scarce. I have different colored silk skirts to wear under them, and
      sashes and beads, and bows, with which to adorn them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little happy pause, then Katherine said, &ldquo;Let us go and see
      Aunt Josepha. I have not seen her for six years. I was counting the time
      as I lay in bed this morning. I was about twelve years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a good idea. We can shop better after we hev hed a talk with
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, mother! You had two Yorkshireisms in that sentence. Father would
      laugh at you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver mind, when my heart talks, my tongue talks as my heart does, and
      Yorkshire is my heart&rsquo;s native tongue. When I talk to thee my tongue
      easily slips into Yorkshire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then a carriage was summoned, and Madam An-nis and her daughter went to
      call on Madam Josepha Temple. They had to ride into the city and through
      St. James Park to a once very fashionable little street leading from the
      park to the river. Madam Temple could have put a fortune in her pocket for
      a strip of this land bordering the river, but no money could induce her to
      sell it. Even the city&rsquo;s offer had been refused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Had not Admiral Temple,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;found land enough for England, and
      fought for land enough for England, for his widow to be allowed to keep in
      peace the strip of land at the foot of the garden he planted and where he
      had also erected a Watergate so beautiful that it had become one of the
      sights of London?&rdquo; And her claim had been politely allowed and she had
      been assured that it would be respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house itself was not remarkable outwardly. It was only one of those
      square brick mansions introduced in the Georgian era, full of large square
      rooms and wide corridors and, in Madam Temple&rsquo;s case, of numerous
      cupboards and closets; for in her directions to the Admiral she had said
      with emphasis:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Admiral, you may as well live in a canvas tent without a convenience of
      any kind as in a house without closets for your dresses and mantuas; and
      cupboards for your china and other things you must have under lock and
      key:&rdquo; and the Admiral had seen to the closet and cupboard subject with
      such strict attention that even his widow sometimes grew testy over their
      number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever faults the house might have, the furnishing had been done with
      great judgment. It was solid and magnificent and only the best tapestries
      and carpets found a place there. To Madam Temple had been left the choice
      of silver, china, linen and damask, and the wisdom and good taste of her
      selection had a kind of official approbation. Artists and silversmiths
      asked her to permit them to copy the shapes of her old silver and she
      possessed many pieces of Wedgwood&rsquo;s finest china of which only a very
      small number had been made ere the mold was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the house was finished the Admiral lived but five years and Madam
      never allowed anything to be changed or renewed. If told that anything was
      fading or wearing, she replied&mdash;&ldquo;I am fading also, just wearing away.
      They will last my time.&rdquo; However the house yet had an air of comfortable
      antique grandeur and it was a favorite place of resort to all who had had
      the good fortune to win the favor of the Admiral&rsquo;s widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were nearing the Temple house, Madam said: &ldquo;The old man who opens
      the door was the Admiral&rsquo;s body servant. He has great influence with your
      aunt; speak pleasantly to him.&rdquo; At these words the carriage stopped and
      the old man of whom Madam had spoken threw open the door and stood waiting
      their approach. He recognized Madam Annis and said with a pleasant respect&mdash;&ldquo;Madam
      will take the right-hand parlor,&rdquo; but ere Madam could do so, Mistress
      Temple appeared. She came hastily forward, talking as she came and full of
      pleasure at the visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear ones!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;How welcome you are! Where is Antony? Why
      didn&rsquo;t he come with you? How is he going to vote? Take off your cloaks and
      bonnets. So this is the little girl I left behind me! You are now a young
      lady, Kate. Who is the favored sweetheart?&rdquo; These interjectory remarks
      were not twaddle, they were the overflow of the heart. Josepha Temple
      meant everything she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Physically she was a feminine portrait of her brother, but in all other
      respects she was herself, and only herself, the result of this world&rsquo;s
      training on one particular soul, for who can tell how many hundred years?
      She had brought from her last life most of her feelings and convictions
      and probably they had the strength and persistence of many reincarnations
      behind them. Later generations than Josepha do not produce such
      characters; alas! their affections for anyone and their beliefs in
      anything are too weak to reincarnate; so they do not come back from the
      grave with them. Josepha was different. Death had had no power over her
      higher self, she was the same passionate lover of Protestantism and the
      righteous freedom of the people that she had been in Cromwell&rsquo;s time; and
      she declared that she had loved her husband ever since he had fought with
      Drake and been Cromwell&rsquo;s greatest naval officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was near sixty but still a very handsome woman, for she was alive from
      the crown of her head to the soles of her feet and disease of any kind had
      not yet found a corner in her body to assail. Her hair was untouched by
      Time, and the widow&rsquo;s cap&mdash;so disfiguring to any woman&mdash;she wore
      with an air that made it appear a very proper and becoming head covering.
      Her gowns were always black merino or cloth in the morning, silk or satin
      or velvet in the afternoon; but they were brightened by deep cuffs and
      long stomachers of white linen, or rich lace, and the skirts of all,
      though quite plain, were of regal length and amplitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Off with your bonnets!&rdquo; she cried joyfully as she kissed Katherine and
      began to untie the elaborate bow of pink satin ribbon under her chin.
      &ldquo;Why, Kate, how lovely you have grown! I thought you would be just an
      ordinary Yorkshire girl&mdash;I find you extraordinary. Upon my word! You
      are a beauty!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, aunt. Mother never told me so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie, do you hear Kate?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it wiser not to tell her such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What trumpery nonsense! Do you say to your roses as they bloom, &lsquo;Do not
      imagine, Miss Rose, that you are lovely, and have a fine perfume. You are
      well enough and your smell isn&rsquo;t half-bad, but there are roses far
      handsomer and sweeter than you are&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their own way, Josepha, all roses are perfect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In their own way, Annie, all women are perfect. Have you had your
      breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An hour ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us talk. Where is Antony? What is he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is doing well. I think he went to see Lord John Russell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can he have to say to Russell? He hasn&rsquo;t sense enough to be on
      Russell&rsquo;s side. Russell is an A. D. 1832 man, Antony dates back two or
      three hundred years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does nothing of that kind. He has been wearing a pair o&rsquo; seven leagued
      boots the past two weeks. Antony&rsquo;s now as far forward as Russell, or Grey,
      or any other noncontent. They&rsquo;ll find that out as soon as he opens his
      mouth in The House of Commons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We call it &lsquo;t&rsquo; Lower House&rsquo; here, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why. As good men are in it as sit in t&rsquo; Upper House or any
      ither place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be because they speak better English there than thou art speaking
      right now, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Annie laughed. &ldquo;I had forgot, Josepha,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, there&rsquo;s nothing to forgive, Annie. I can talk Yorkshire as well as
      iver I did, if I want to. After all, it&rsquo;s the best and purest English
      going and if you want your awn way or to get your rights, or to make your
      servants do as they&rsquo;re told, a mouthful of Yorkshire will do it&mdash;or
      nothing will. And I was telling Dick only the other day, to try a bit o&rsquo; 
      Yorkshire on a little lass he is varry bad in love with&mdash;just at
      present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katherine had been standing at her aunt&rsquo;s embroidery frame admiring its
      exquisite work but as soon as she heard this remark, she came quickly to
      the fireside where the elder ladies had sat down together. They had lifted
      the skirts of their dresses across their knees to prevent the fire from
      drawing the color and put their feet comfortably on the shining fender and
      Katherine did not find them indisposed to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is it, aunt?&rdquo; she asked with some excitement. &ldquo;What is her name? Is
      she Yorkshire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, I doan&rsquo;t think she hes any claim on Yorkshire. I think she comes
      Westmoreland way. She is a sister to a member of the Lower House called De
      Burg. He&rsquo;s a handsome lad to look at. I hevn&rsquo;t hed time yet to go
      further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen this little girl, aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She was here once with her brother. He says she has never been much
      from home before, and Dick says, that as far as he can make out, her home
      is a gray old castle among the bleak, desolate, Westmoreland Mountains. It
      might be a kindness for Katherine to go and see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will go with me, aunt, I will do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I. Take Dick with thee. He will fill the bill all round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I will ask Dick;&rdquo; and to these words the squire entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to be a little offended because no one had seen him coming and
      all three women assumed an air of contrition for having neglected to be on
      the lookout for him. &ldquo;We were all so interested about Dick&rsquo;s new
      sweetheart,&rdquo; said Madam Annis, &ldquo;and somehow, thou slipped out of mind for
      a few minutes. It <i>was</i> thoughtless, Antony, it was that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you had a good meal lately, Antony?&rdquo; asked his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Josepha, I hevn&rsquo;t. I came to ask thee to give me a bit of lunch. I
      hev an appointment at three o&rsquo;clock for The House and I shall need a good
      substantial bite, for there&rsquo;s no saying when I&rsquo;ll get away from there.
      What can thou give me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oysters, hare soup, roast beef, and a custard pudding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All good enough. I suppose there&rsquo;ll be a Yorkshire pudding with thy beef;
      it would seem queer and half-done without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Antony, I suppose I do know how to roast beef before t&rsquo; fire and
      put a pudding under it. I&rsquo;d be badly educated, if I didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If Yorkshire pudding is to be the test, Josepha, then thou art one of the
      best educated women in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, Dick&rsquo;s new love is Miss De Burg. What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might do worse than marry a De Burg, and he might do better. I&rsquo;m not
      in a mood to talk about anyone&rsquo;s marriage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not even of mine, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thine, least of all. And thou hes to get a decent lover before thou hes
      to ask me if he can be thy husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev a very good lover, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thou hes not. Not one that can hev a welcome in my family and home.
      Not one! No doubt thou wilt hev plenty before we leave London. Get thy
      mother to help thee choose the right one. <i>There now!</i> That&rsquo;s enough
      of such foolishness! My varry soul is full of matters of life or death to
      England. I hev not one thought for lovers and husbands at this time. Why,
      England is varry near rebellion, and I tell you three women there is no
      Oliver Cromwell living now to guide her over the bogs of misgovernment and
      anarchy. Russell said this morning, &lsquo;it was the Reform Bill or
      Revolution.&rsquo;&rdquo; Then lunch was brought in and the subject was dropped until
      the squire lit his pipe for &ldquo;a bit of a smoke.&rdquo; Katherine was, however,
      restless and anxious; she was watching for her sister&rsquo;s arrival and when
      the squire heard of the intended visit, he said: &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t want to see
      Jane this afternoon. Tell her I&rsquo;ll see her at her home this evening and,
      Josepha, I&rsquo;ll smoke my pipe down the garden to the Watergate and take a
      boat there for Westminster. Then I can smoke all the way. I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t
      tell what I would do without it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And as they watched him down to the Watergate, they heard Jane&rsquo;s carriage
      stop at the street entrance.

      CHAPTER V&mdash;THE DISORDER CALLED LOVE
    </h2>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;She was good as she was fair
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      None on earth above her!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      As pure in thought as angels are,
    </p>

      To know her was to love her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE three ladies
      had reached the open door in time to watch Lady Jane leave her carriage, a
      movement not easy to describe, for it was the result of an action
      practiced from early childhood, and combining with the unconscious grace
      and ease of habitual action, a certain decisive touch of personality, that
      made for distinction. She was dressed in the visiting costume of the
      period, a not more ungraceful one than the fashion of the present time.
      Its material was rich violet poplin and it appeared to be worn over a
      small hoop. It was long enough to touch the buckles on her sandaled shoes
      and its belt line was in the proper place. The bodice was cut low to the
      shoulders and the sleeves were large and full to the elbows, then tight to
      the wrists. A little cape not falling below the belt and handsomely
      trimmed with ermine, completed the costume. The bonnets of that time were
      large and very high and open, adorned with ostrich feathers much curled
      and standing fancifully upright. Jane&rsquo;s was of this shape and the open
      space across the head was filled with artificial flowers, but at the sides
      were loose, long curls of her own splendid hair, falling below her throat,
      and over the ermine trimmed cape. This bonnet was tied under the chin with
      a handsome bow of violet ribbon. All the smaller items of her dress were
      perfect in their way, not only with the mode, but also in strict propriety
      with her general appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was warmly welcomed and responded to it with hearty acquiescence, her
      attitude towards Katherine being specially lovely and affectionate. &ldquo;My
      little sister is a beauty!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am so proud of her. And now let
      us have a little talk about her gowns and bonnets! She must have some
      pretty ones, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shall have all that is needful, Jane,&rdquo; said Mrs. Annis. &ldquo;Their cost
      will not break her father, just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must ask me to go with you to shop, mother. I think I can be of great
      use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course. We have calculated on your help. Will you come to the hotel
      for me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here! Hold on bit!&rdquo; cried Aunt Josepha. &ldquo;Am I invited, or not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, Josepha,&rdquo; answered Mistress Annis very promptly. &ldquo;We cannot do
      without you. You will go with us, of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, as to-morrow is neither Wednesday, nor Friday, I may do so&mdash;but
      I leave myself free. I may not go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why would Wednesday and Friday be objectionable, Josepha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annie, if thou hed done as much business with the world as I hev
      done, thou&rsquo;d know by this time of thy life that thou couldn&rsquo;t make a good
      bargain on either o&rsquo; them days. There&rsquo;s some hope on a Friday because if
      Friday isn&rsquo;t the worst day in the week it&rsquo;s the very best. There is no
      perhaps about Wednesday. I allays let things bide as they are on
      Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I come here for you, aunt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Jane. If I go with you I will be at the Clarendon with Annie at
      half-past nine. If I&rsquo;m not there at that time I will not be going&mdash;no,
      not for love or money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you will go the next day&mdash;sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of sureness in me. I doan&rsquo;t know how I&rsquo;ll be feeling the next
      day. Take off your bonnet and cape, Jane, and sit down. I want to see how
      you look. We&rsquo;ll hev our little talk and by and by a cup of tea, and then
      thou can run away as soon as tha likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot stay very long. I have a dinner tonight, and my servants need
      overlooking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope that cynical De Burg is not going to eat with you. He&rsquo;ll niver
      break bread at my table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, aunt, he is a man of the highest culture and one of the best
      speakers in The House!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him talk as much as he likes in t&rsquo; House; there&rsquo;s a few men to match
      him there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How has he offended you, aunt? He is quite a favorite with Leyland and
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever does tha see in his favor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has such a fine bearing and such graceful manners. Leyland says that
      in the most excited hubbubs of The House, he carries himself with all the
      serenity and aristocratic poise of an English gentleman&mdash;I should
      say, nobleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no wonder tha forgets his nobility. It only counts to his
      grandfather. I&rsquo;ll tell thee something, Jane&mdash;a gentleman is allays a
      nobleman, a nobleman may be a gentleman, and he may be varry far from it;
      but there, now! I&rsquo;ll say no more, or I&rsquo;ll mebbe say too much! How many
      dresses does our beauty want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This question opened a discussion of such interest that a servant entered
      with the tea service and hot crumpets before they were thinking of the
      time; and half an hour afterwards Katherine was ready to accompany her
      sister to the Leyland home.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first two weeks, the early part of Katherine&rsquo;s days were spent
      either in shopping, or in &ldquo;trying on,&rdquo; and such events rarely need more
      than an allusion. Every woman has some, or all of the experiences incident
      to this trial; but though they may be of personal importance, they have no
      general interest. We may pass Katherine&rsquo;s dressmaking trials, by knowing
      that they were in the hands of four or five women capable of arranging
      them in the most satisfactory manner. Katherine herself left them as early
      as possible, and spent the most of her time in her father&rsquo;s company, and
      Lady Jane approved transiently of this arrangement. She did not wish
      Katherine to be seen and talked about until she was formally introduced
      and could make a proper grand entry into the society she wished her to
      enter. Of course there were suppositions floating about concerning the
      young lady seen so much with Lady Leyland; but as long as the talk
      remained indefinite, it was stimulating and working for a successful
      début.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interval was in many ways very pleasant to Katherine for the squire
      took her to all those sights of London which people are expected to know
      all about&mdash;the Tower&mdash;the British Museum&mdash;St. Paul&rsquo;s Church
      and Westminster Abbey; and so forth. Sometimes the squire met an old
      acquaintance from his own neighborhood and they went somewhere and had a
      cup of tea together, the squire simply saying, &ldquo;This is my little girl,
      Denby; my youngest.&rdquo; Such an introduction demanded nothing but a smile and
      a few courteous words, and these civilities Katherine managed with
      retiring modesty and simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, one morning, as they were walking down High Holborn, they met a near
      neighbor, a very shrewd, cheerful gentleman, called Samuel Wade, the
      squire of Everdeen. Annis and Katherine had turned into a pretty white
      dairy for a plate of Devonshire cream and Samuel Wade was slowly and
      thoughtfully partaking of the same dainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, Wade! Whatever hes brought thee away from thy hounds and kennels
      this fine spring weather?&rdquo; asked Annis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell thee, Annis, if tha&rsquo; will give me a halfhour and I know no
      man I could be so glad to see as thysen. I&rsquo;m in a quandary, squire, and I
      would be glad of a word or two with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, then, thou hes it! What does t&rsquo;a want to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a</i>, Annis, I want to tell thee I am building a mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Niver! Niver!</i> Thee building a mill! I niver thought of such a
      to-do as that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nor I, either, till I was forced to do it, but when that hour arrived, my
      weavers and I came to the conclusion that we weren&rsquo;t bound to starve to
      save anybody&rsquo;s trade feelings. So I agreed to put up a factory and they
      hev got work here and there just to learn the ways of this new-fangled
      loom, so that when I hev t&rsquo; factory ready they&rsquo;ll be ready for it and glad
      enough to come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the man to blame thee, Samuel; I hev hed some such thoughts
      mysen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was our preacher that put it into my mind. He said to us one night
      when the men had been complaining of machine labor&mdash;&lsquo;Brothers, when
      God is on the side of civilization and the power-loom, how are you going
      to use the hand loom? The hand loom is dead and buried,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and
      what is the use of keeping up a constant burying of this same old
      Defuncter. It&rsquo;ll cost you all the brass you hev and you&rsquo;ll die poor and
      good for nothing. The world is moving and you can&rsquo;t hold it back. It will
      just kick you off as cumberers of the ground.&rsquo; And after that talk three
      men went out of t&rsquo; chapel and began to build factories; and I was one of
      t&rsquo; three and I&rsquo;m none sorry for it&mdash;<i>yet</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where is tha building?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down t&rsquo; Otley road a few miles from my awn house, but my three lads are
      good riders and it would be hard to beat me unless it was with better
      stock than I hev; and I niver let anyone best me in that way if I can help
      it. So the few miles does not bother us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you build so far from Wade House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a</i>, squire, I didn&rsquo;t want to hev the sight of the blamed thing
      before my eyes, morning, noon and night, and t&rsquo; land I bought was varry
      cheap and hed plenty of water-power on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. I hed forgot. Well then what brought thee to London? It is a
      rayther dangerous place now, I can tell thee that; or it will be, if
      Parliament doesn&rsquo;t heed the warnings given and shown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annis, I came on my awn business and I&rsquo;m not thinking of bothering
      Parliament at present. A factory is enough for all the brains I hev, for
      tha knows well that my brains run after horses&mdash;but I&rsquo;ll tell thee
      what, factories hey a wonderful way of getting into your pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing out of the way with thee. Thy pocket is too full, but I
      should think a factory might be built in Yorkshire without coming to
      London about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annis, tha knaws that if I meddle wi&rsquo; anything, I&rsquo;ll do what I do,
      tip-top or not at all. I hed the best of factory architects Leeds could
      give me and I hev ordered the best of power looms and of ivery other bit
      of machinery; but t&rsquo; ither day a man from Manchester went through Wade
      Mill and he asked me how many Jacquard looms I was going to run. I hed
      niver heard of that kind of a loom, but I felt I must hev some. Varry soon
      I found out that none of the weavers round Otley way knew anything about
      Jacquard looms and they didn&rsquo;t seem to want to know either, but my eldest
      lad, Sam, said he would like to hev some and to know all about them. So I
      made good inquiry and I found out the best of all the Jacquard weavers in
      England lived in a bit of London called Spitalfields. He is a Frenchman, I
      suppose, for his name is Pierre Delaney.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did you send your son to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did that and now Sam knows all about Jacquard looms, for he sent me
      word he was coming home after a week in London just to look about him and
      then I thought I would like to see the machine at work and get the name of
      the best maker of it. So I came at once and I&rsquo;m stopping at the hotel
      where t&rsquo; mail coach stopped, but I&rsquo;m fairly bewildered. Sam has left his
      stopping place and I rayther think is on his way home. I was varry glad to
      see thy face among so many strange ones. I can tell thee that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can I help thee, Wade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, thou can go with me to see this Jacquard loom and give me thy
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev niver seen a Jacquard loom mysen and I would like to see one; but I
      could not go now, for as tha sees I hev my little lass with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I want to see this loom at this place called Spitalfields. Let me
      go with you. Please, father, let me go with you; do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to hinder,&rdquo; said Squire Wade. &ldquo;I should think, Annis,
      that thou and mysen could take care of t&rsquo; little lass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, we will go at once. The day is yet early and bright, but no
      one can tell what it will be in an hour or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Wade called a coach and they drove to London&rsquo;s famous manufacturing
      district noted for the excellence of its brocaded silks and velvet, and
      the beauty and variety of its ribbons, satins and lutestrings. The ride
      there was full of interest to Katherine and she needed no explanation
      concerning the groups of silent men standing at street corners sullen and
      desperate-looking, or else listening to some passionate speaker. Annis and
      Wade looked at each other and slightly shook their heads but did not make
      any remark. The locality was not a pleasant one; it spoke only of labor
      that was too urgent to have time for &ldquo;dressing up,&rdquo; as Pierre Delaney&mdash;the
      man they were visiting&mdash;explained to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found Delaney in his weaving shop, a large many-windowed room full of
      strange looking looms and of men silent and intensely pre-occupied. No one
      looked round when they entered, and as Wade and Annis talked to the
      proprietor, Katherine cast her eyes curiously over the room. She saw that
      it was full of looms, large ponderous looms, with much slower and heavier
      movements than the usual one; and she could not help feeling that the
      long, dangling, yellow harness which hung about each loom fettered and in
      some way impeded its motion. The faces of all the workers were turned from
      the door and they appeared to be working slowly and with such strict
      attention that not one man hesitated, or looked round, though they must
      have known that strangers had entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Katherine&rsquo;s curiosity was intense. She wanted to go close
      to the looms, and watch the men at what seemed to be difficult work.
      However, she had scarcely felt the thrill of this strong desire ere her
      father took her hand and they went with Delaney to a loom at the head of
      the room. He said &ldquo;he was going to show them the work of one of his
      pupils, who had great abilities for patterns requiring unwavering
      attention and great patience; but in fact,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;every weaver in
      this room has as much as he can manage, if he keeps his loom going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man whose work they were going to examine must have heard them
      approaching, but he made no sign of such intelligence until they stood at
      his side. Then he lifted his head, and as he did so, Katherine cried out&mdash;&ldquo;Father!
      Father! It is Harry! It is Harry Bradley! Oh Harry! Harry! Whatever are
      you doing here?&rdquo; And then her voice broke down in a cry that was full both
      of laughter and tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was really Harry Bradley, and with a wondering happy look he
      leaped from his seat, threw off his cap and so in a laughing hurry he
      stood before them. Squire Annis was so amazed he forgot that he was no
      longer friends with Harry&rsquo;s father and he gave an honest expression of his
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a</i>, Harry! Harry! Whativer is tha up to? Does thy father know
      the kind of game thou art playing now, lad?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire, dear! It is business, not play, that I am up to. I am happy
      beyond words to see you, squire! I have often walked the road you take to
      The House, hoping I might do so.&rdquo; And the young man put out his hand, and
      without thinking, the squire took it. Acting on impulse, he could not help
      taking it. Harry was too charming, too delightful to resist. He wore his
      working apron without any consciousness of it and his handsome face and
      joyful voice and manner made those few moments all his own. The squire was
      taken captive by a happy surprise and eagerly seconded Katherine&rsquo;s desire
      to see him at such absorbing work as his loom appeared to require.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry took his seat again without parleying or excuse. He was laughing as
      he did so, but as soon as he faced the wonderful design before him, he
      appeared to be unconscious of everything else. His watchers were quickly
      lost in an all absorbing interest as they saw an exquisite design of
      leaves and flowers growing with every motion of the shuttle, while the
      different threads of the harness rose and fell as if to some perfectly
      measured tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he worked his face changed, the boyish, laughing expression
      disappeared, and it was a man&rsquo;s face full of watchful purpose, alert and
      carefully bent on one object and one end. The squire noticed the change
      and he admired it. He wished secretly that he could see the same manly
      look on Dick&rsquo;s face, forgetting that he had never seen Dick under the same
      mental strain.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this reflection was only a thread running through his immense pleasure
      in the result of Harry&rsquo;s wonderful manipulation of the forces at his
      command and his first impulse was to ask Harry to take dinner with him and
      Wade, at the Clarendon. He checked himself as regarded dinner, but he
      asked Harry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where art thou staying, Harry? I shouldn&rsquo;t think Spitalfields quite the
      place for thy health.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am only here for working hours, squire. I have a good room at the
      Yorkshire Club and I have a room when I want it at Mistress Temple&rsquo;s. I
      often stay there when Dick is in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My word!&rdquo; ejaculated the squire. He felt at once that the young man had
      no need of his kindness, and his interest in him received a sudden chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      This conversation occurred as Wade and Delaney were walking down the room
      together talking about Jacquard looms and their best maker. Katherine had
      been hitherto silent as far as words were concerned, but she had slipped
      her hand into Harry&rsquo;s hand when he had finished his exhibition at the
      loom. It was her way of praising him and Harry had held the little hand
      fast and was still doing so when the squire said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, looms are wonderful creatures&mdash;ay, and I&rsquo;ll call them
      &lsquo;creatures.&rsquo; They hev sense or they know how to use the sense of men that
      handle them properly. I hev seen plenty of farm laborers that didn&rsquo;t know
      that much; but those patterns you worked from, they are beyond my making
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, squire, many designs are very elaborate, requiring from twenty
      thousand to sixty thousand cards for a single design. Weaving like that is
      a fine art, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou art right. Is tha going to stay here any longer to-day or will tha
      ride back with us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, sir, if I only might go back with you! In five minutes, I will be
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire turned hastily away with three short words, &ldquo;Make haste, then.&rdquo;
       He was put out by the manner in which Harry had taken his civil offer. He
      had only meant to give him a lift back to his club but Harry appeared to
      have understood it as an invitation to dinner. He was wondering how he
      could get out of the dilemma and so did not notice that Harry kissed
      Katherine&rsquo;s hand as he turned away. Harry had found few opportunities to
      address her, none at all for private speech, yet both Katherine and Harry
      were satisfied. For every pair of lovers have a code of their own and no
      one else has the key to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time Harry reappeared in a very dudish walking suit, but Wade
      and Delaney were not ready to separate and the squire was hard set to hide
      his irritability. Harry also looked too happy, and too handsome, for the
      gentlemen&rsquo;s dress of A. D. 1833 was manly and becoming, with its high hat,
      pointed white vest, frock coat, and long thin cane, always carried in the
      left hand. However, conversation even about money comes to an end and at
      length Wade was satisfied, and they turned city-ward in order to leave
      Wade at his hotel. On arriving there, Annis was again detained by Wade&rsquo;s
      anxieties and fears, but Harry had a five minutes&rsquo; heavenly interlude. He
      was holding Katherine&rsquo;s hand and looking into her eyes and saying little
      tender, foolish words, which had no more meaning than a baby&rsquo;s prattle,
      but Katherine&rsquo;s heart was their interpreter and every syllable was sweet
      as the dropping of the honey-comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all this broken conversation, however, Harry was wondering how he
      could manage to leave the coach with Katherine. If he could only see Lady
      Jane, he knew she would ask him to remain, but how was he to see Lady Jane
      and what excuse could he make for asking to see her? It never struck the
      young man that the squire was desirous to get rid of him. He was only
      conscious of the fact that he did not particularly desire an evening with
      Katherine&rsquo;s father and mother and that he did wish very ardently to spend
      an evening with Katherine and Lady Jane; and the coach went so quick, and
      his thoughts were all in confusion, and they were at the Leyland mansion
      before he had decided what to say, or do. Then the affair that seemed so
      difficult, straightened itself out in a perfectly natural, commonplace
      manner. For when Katherine rose, as a matter of course, Harry also rose;
      and without effort, or consideration, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make way for you, squire, or if you wish no further delay, I will
      see Katherine into Lady Leyland&rsquo;s care.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be obliged to you, Harry, if you will do so,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I
      am a bit tired and a bit late, and Mistress Annis will be worrying hersen
      about me, no doubt. I was just thinking of asking you to do me this
      favor.&rdquo; Then the squire left a message for his eldest daughter and drove
      rapidly away, but if he had turned his head for a moment he might have
      seen how happily the lovers were slowly climbing the white marble steps
      leading them to Lady Leyland&rsquo;s door. Hand in hand they went, laughing a
      little as they talked, because Harry was telling Katherine how he had been
      racking his brains for some excuse to leave the coach with her and how the
      very words had come at the moment they were wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the very same time the squire was telling himself &ldquo;how cleverly he had
      got rid of the young fellow. He would hev bothered Annie above a bit,&rdquo; he
      reflected, &ldquo;and it was a varry thoughtless thing for me to do&mdash;asking
      a man to dinner, when I know so well that Annie likes me best when I am
      all by mysen. Well, I got out of that silly affair cleverly. It is a good
      thing to hev a faculty for readiness and I&rsquo;m glad to say that readiness is
      one thing that Annie thinks Antony Annis hes on call. Well, well, the lad
      was glad to leave me and I was enough pleased to get rid of him.&rdquo; And if
      any good fellow should read this last paragraph he will not require me to
      tell him how the little incident of &ldquo;getting rid of Harry&rdquo; brightened the
      squire&rsquo;s dinner, nor how sweetly Annie told her husband that he was &ldquo;the
      kindest-hearted of men and could do a disagreeable thing in such an
      agreeable manner, as no other man, she had ever met, would think of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he told Annie about the Jacquard loom and Harry&rsquo;s mastery of it, and
      when this subject was worn out, Annie told her husband that Jane was going
      to introduce Katherine to London society on the following Tuesday evening.
      She wanted to make it Wednesday evening, but &ldquo;Josepha would not hear of
      it&rdquo;&mdash;she said, with an air of injury, &ldquo;and Josepha always gets what
      she desires.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why shouldn&rsquo;t Josepha get all she desires? When a woman hes a million
      pounds to give away beside property worth a fortune the world hes no more
      to give her but her awn way. I should think Josepha is one of the richest
      women in England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;However did the Admiral get so much money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All prize money, Annie. Good, honest, prize money! The Admiral&rsquo;s money
      was the price of his courage. He threshed England&rsquo;s enemies for every
      pound of it; and when we were fighting Spain, Spanish galleons, loaded
      with Brazilian gold, were varry good paymasters even though Temple was
      both just and generous to his crews.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder then, if Josepha be one of the richest women in England. Who is
      the richest man, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, Annie! I am! Thou art my wife and there is not gold enough in
      England to measure thy worth nor yet to have made me happy if I had missed
      thee.&rdquo; What else could a wise and loving husband say?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Katherine and Harry had been gladly received by Lady Jane,
      who at once asked Harry to stay and dine with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What about my street suit?&rdquo; asked Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a family dinner this evening and expect no one to join us. De
      Burg may probably call and he may bring his sister with him. However,
      Harry, you know your old room on the third floor. I will send Leyland&rsquo;s
      valet there and he will manage to make you presentable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These instructions Harry readily obeyed, and soon as he had left the room
      Lady Jane asked&mdash;&ldquo;Where did you pick him up, Kitty? He is quite a
      detrimental in father&rsquo;s opinion, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I picked him up in a weaving room in the locality called Spitalfields. He
      was working there on a Jacquard loom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What nonsense you are talking!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am telling you facts, Jane. I will explain them later. Now I must go
      and dress for dinner, if you are expecting the De Burgs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They will only pay an evening call, but make yourself as pretty as is
      proper for the occasion. If De Burg does not bring his sister you will not
      be expected to converse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jane dear! I am not thinking, or caring, about the De Burgs. My mind
      was on Harry and of course I shall dress a little for Harry. I have always
      done that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will take your own way, Kitty, that also you have always done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, is there any reason why I should not take my own way now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She asked this question in a pleasant, laughing manner that required no
      answer; and with it disappeared not returning to the parlor, until the
      dinner hour was imminent. She found Harry and Lady Jane already there, and
      she fancied they were talking rather seriously. In fact, Harry had eagerly
      seized this opportunity to try and enlist Jane&rsquo;s sympathy in his love for
      Katherine. He had passionately urged their long devotion to each other and
      entreated her to give him some opportunities to retain his hold on her
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane had in no way compromised her own position. She was kind-hearted and
      she had an old liking for Harry, but she was ambitious, and she was
      resolved that Katherine should make an undeniably good alliance. De Burg
      was not equal to her expectations but she judged he would be a good
      auxiliary to them. &ldquo;My beautiful sister,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;must have a
      splendid following of lovers and De Burg will make a prominent member of
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she was not sorry to see Katherine enter in a pretty, simple frock of
      flowered silk, pale blue in color, and further softened by a good deal of
      Valenciennes lace and a belt and long sash of white ribbon. Her hair was
      dressed in the mode, lifted high and loosely, and confined by an exquisite
      comb of carved ivory; the frontal curls were pushed behind the ears, but
      fell in bright luxuriance almost to her belt. So fair was she, so fresh
      and sweet and lovely, that Leyland&mdash;who was both sentimental and
      poetic, within practical limits&mdash;thought instantly of Ben Jonson&rsquo;s
      exquisite lines, and applied them to his beautiful sister-in-law:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Have you seen but a bright lily grow
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Before rude hands have touched it?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Have you marked but the fall of the snow
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Before the soil hath smutched it?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Have you smelt of the bud of the brier,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Or the nard in the fire?
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Or tasted the bag of the bee,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      O so white! O so soft! O so sweet is she!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he felt a decided obligation to his own good judgment, for
      inducing him to marry into so handsome a family.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a comfortable mood in which to sit down to dinner and Harry&rsquo;s
      presence also added to his pleasure, for it promised him some conversation
      not altogether feminine. Indeed, though the dinner was a simple family
      one, it was a very delightful meal. Leyland quoted some of his shortest
      and finest lines, Lady Jane merrily recalled childish episodes in which
      Harry and herself played the principal rôles, and Katherine made funny
      little corrections and additions to her sister&rsquo;s picturesque childish
      adventures; also, being healthily hungry, she ate a second supply of her
      favorite pudding and thus made everyone comfortably sure that for all her
      charm and loveliness, she was yet a creature
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Not too bright and good,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      For human nature&rsquo;s daily food.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They lingered long at the happy table and were still laughing and cracking
      nuts round it when De Burg was announced. He was accompanied by a new
      member of Parliament from Carlisle and the conversation drifted quickly to
      politics. De Burg wanted to know if Leyland was going to The House. He
      thought there would be a late sitting and said there was a tremendous
      crowd round the parliament buildings, &ldquo;but,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;my friend was
      amazed at the dead silence which pervaded it, and, indeed, if you compare
      this voiceless manifestation of popular feeling with the passionate
      turbulence of the same crowd, it is very remarkable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And it is much more dangerous,&rdquo; answered Ley-land. &ldquo;The voiceless anger
      of an English crowd is very like the deathly politeness of the man who
      brings you a challenge. As soon as they become quiet they are ready for
      action. We are apt to call them uneducated, but in politics they have been
      well taught by their leaders who are generally remarkably clever men, and
      it is said also that one man in seventeen among our weavers can read and
      perhaps even sign his name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That one is too many,&rdquo; replied De Burg. &ldquo;It makes them dangerous. Yet men
      like Lord Brougham are always writing and talking about it being our duty
      to educate them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Sir Brougham formed a society for &lsquo;The Diffusion of Useful
      Knowledge&rsquo; four or five years ago&mdash;an entirely new sort of knowledge
      for working men&mdash;knowledge relating to this world, personal and
      municipal. That is how he actually described his little sixpenny books.
      Then some Scotchman called Chambers began to publish a cheap magazine. I
      take it. It is not bad at all&mdash;but things like these are going to
      make literature cheap and common.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I heard my own clergyman say that he considered secular teaching of
      the poor classes to be hostile to Christianity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Jane remarked&mdash;as if to herself&mdash;&ldquo;How dangerous to
      good society the Apostles must have been!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leyland smiled at his wife and answered, &ldquo;They were. They changed it
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The outlook is very bad,&rdquo; continued De Burg. &ldquo;The tide of democracy is
      setting in. It will sweep us all away and break down every barrier raised
      by civilization. And we may play at Canute, if we like, but&mdash;&rdquo; and De
      Burg shook his head and was silent in that hopeless fashion that
      represents circumstances perfectly desperate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leyland took De Burg&rsquo;s prophetic gloom quite cheerfully. He had a verse
      ready for it and he gave it with apparent pleasure&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Yet men will still be ruled by men,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      And talk will have its day,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And other men will come again
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      To chase the rogues away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to be the way things are ordered, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Leyland&rsquo;s poetic interval, Lady Jane glanced at her husband and
      said: &ldquo;Let us forget politics awhile. If we go to the drawing-room,
      perhaps Miss Annis or Mr. Bradley will give us a song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Everyone gladly accepted the proposal and followed Lady Jane to the
      beautiful, light warm room.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so gay with flowers and color, it was so softly lit by wax candles
      and the glow of the fire, it was so comfortably warmed by the little blaze
      on the white marble hearth, that the spirits of all experienced a sudden
      happy uplift. De Burg went at once to the fireside. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
      &ldquo;how good is the fire! How cheerful, how homelike! Every day in the year,
      I have fires in some rooms in the castle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, De Burg, how is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Leyland, my home is surrounded by mountains and I may say I am
      in the clouds most of the time. We are far north from here and I am so
      much alone I have made a friend of the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought, sir, your mother lived with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am unhappy in her long and frequent absences. My cousin Agatha cannot
      bear the climate. She is very delicate and my mother takes her southward
      for the winters. They are now in the Isle of Wight but they will be in
      London within a week. For a short time they will remain with me then they
      return to De Burg Castle until the cold drives them south again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lady Jane offered some polite sympathies and De Burg from his vantage
      ground of the hearth-rug surveyed the room. Its beauty and fitness
      delighted him and he at once began to consider how the De Burg
      drawing-room would look if arranged after its fashion. He could not help
      this method of looking at whatever was beautiful and appropriate; he had
      to place the thing, whatever it was, in a position which related itself
      either to De Burg, or the De Burg possessions. So when he had placed the
      Ley-land drawing-room in the gloomy De Burg Castle, he took into his
      consideration Katherine Annis as the mistress of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was sitting with Harry near the piano and her sister was
      standing before her with some music in her hand. &ldquo;You are now going to
      sing for us, Katherine,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and you will help Katherine, dear
      Harry, for you know all her songs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear lady, I cannot on any account sing tonight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No entreaties could alter Harry&rsquo;s determination and it was during this
      little episode De Burg approached. Hearing the positive refusal, he
      offered his services with that air of certain satisfaction which insured
      its acceptance. Then the songs he could sing were to be selected, and this
      gave him a good opportunity of talking freely with the girl whom he might
      possibly choose for the wife of a De Burg and the mistress of his ancient
      castle. He found her sweet and obliging and ready to sing whatever he
      thought most suitable to the compass and quality of his voice, and as Lord
      and Lady Leyland assisted in this choice, Harry was left alone; but when
      the singing began Harry was quickly at Katherine&rsquo;s side, making the
      turning of the music sheets his excuse for interference. It appeared quite
      proper to De Burg that someone should turn the leaves for him and he
      acknowledged the courtesy by a bend of his head and afterwards thanked
      Harry for the civility, saying, &ldquo;it enabled him to do justice to his own
      voice and also to the rather difficult singing of the fair songstress.&rdquo; He
      put himself first, because at the moment he was really feeling that his
      voice and personality had been the dominating quality in the two songs
      they sang together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though De Burg did his best and the Leylands expressed their pleasure
      charmingly and Harry bowed and smiled, no one was enthusiastic; and
      Ley-land could not find any quotation to cap the presumed pleasure the
      music had given them. Then Harry seized the opportunity that came with the
      rise of Katherine to offer his arm and lead her to their former seat on
      the sofa leaving De Burg to the society of Leyland and his wife. He had
      come, however, to the conclusion that Katherine was worthy of further
      attentions, but he did not make on her young and tender heart any fixed or
      favorable impression. For this man with all his considerations had not yet
      learned that the selfish lover never really succeeds; that the woman he
      attempts to woo just looks at him and then turns to something more
      interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, the music had not united the small gathering, indeed it had
      more certainly divided them. Lord Leyland remained at De Burg&rsquo;s side and
      Lady Jane through some natural inclination joined them. For she had no
      intention in the matter, it merely pleased her to do it, and it certainly
      pleased Katherine and Harry that she had left them at liberty to please
      each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine had felt a little hurt by her lover&rsquo;s refusal to sing but he had
      promised to explain his reason for doing so to Jane and herself when they
      were alone; and she had accepted this put-off apology in a manner so sweet
      and confiding that it would have satisfied even De Burg&rsquo;s idea of a wife&rsquo;s
      subordination to her husband&rsquo;s feelings or caprices.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Burg did not remain much longer; he made some remark about his duty
      being now at The House, as it was likely to be a very late sitting but he
      did not forget in taking leave to speak of Katherine&rsquo;s début on the
      following Tuesday and to ask Lady Leyland&rsquo;s permission to bring with him
      his cousin Agatha De Burg if she was fortunate enough to arrive in time;
      and this permission being readily granted he made what he told himself was
      a very properly timed and elegant exit. This he really accomplished for he
      was satisfied with his evening and somehow both his countenance and
      manners expressed his content.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leyland laughed a little about De Burg&rsquo;s sense of duty to The House, and
      made his usual quotation for the over-zealous&mdash;about new brooms
      sweeping clean&mdash;and Lady Jane praised his fine manner, and his
      correct singing, but Katherine and Harry made no remark. Leyland, however,
      was not altogether pleased with the self-complacent, faithful member of
      parliament. &ldquo;Jane,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what did the man mean by saying, &lsquo;his
      political honesty must not be found wanting&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I think, Frederick, that was a very honorable feeling!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, but members of parliament do not usually make their political
      honesty an excuse for cutting short a social call. I wish our good father
      Antony Annis had heard him. He would have given him a mouthful of
      Yorkshire, that he would never have been able to forget. How does the man
      reckon himself? I believe he thinks he is honoring <i>us</i> by his
      presence. No doubt, he thinks it only fit that you call your social year
      after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The De Burg Year? Eh, Fred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the happy year in which you made the De Burg acquaintance. My dear,
      should that acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind?&rdquo; Then they
      all laughed merrily, and Leyland asked: &ldquo;Why did you refuse to sing,
      Harry? It was so unlike you that I would not urge your compliance. I knew
      you must have a good reason for the refusal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the best of reasons, sir, a solemn promise that I made my father. I
      will tell you all about it. We gave our factory hands a dinner and dance
      last Christmas and I went with father to give them a Christmas greeting. A
      large number were already present and were passing the time in singing and
      story-telling until dinner was served. One of the men asked&mdash;&lsquo;if
      Master Harry would give them a song,&rsquo;&mdash;and I did so. I thought a
      comic song would be the most suitable and I sang &lsquo;The Yorkshire Man.&rsquo; I
      had sung it at the Mill Owners&rsquo; quarterly dinner, amid shouts of laughter,
      and I was sure it was just the thing for the present occasion. Certainly,
      I was not disappointed by its reception. Men and women both went wild over
      it but I could see that my father was annoyed and displeased, and after I
      had finished he hardly spoke until the dinner was served. Then he only
      said grace over the food and wished all a good New Year, and so speedily
      went away. It wasn&rsquo;t like father a bit, and I was troubled about it. As
      soon as we were outside, I said, &lsquo;Whatever is the matter, father? Who, or
      what, has vexed you?&rsquo; And he said, &lsquo;Thou, thysen, Harry, hes put me out
      above a bit. I thought thou would hev hed more sense than to sing that
      fool song among t&rsquo; weavers. It was bad enough when tha sung it at t&rsquo; 
      Master dinner but it were a deal worse among t&rsquo; crowd we have just left.&rsquo; 
      I said I did not understand and he answered&mdash;&lsquo;Well, then, lad, I&rsquo;ll
      try and make thee understand. It is just this way&mdash;if ta iver means
      to be a man of weight in business circles, if ta iver means to be
      respected and looked up to, if ta iver thinks of a seat i&rsquo; parliament, or
      of wearing a Lord Mayor&rsquo;s gold chain, then don&rsquo;t thee sing a note when
      there&rsquo;s anybody present but thy awn family. It lets a man down at once to
      sing outside his awn house. It does that! If ta iver means to stand a bit
      above the ordinary, or to rule men in any capacity, don&rsquo;t sing to them, or
      iver try in any way to amuse them. Praise them, or scold them, advise
      them, or even laugh at them, but don&rsquo;t thee sing to them, or make them
      laugh. The moment tha does that, they hev the right to laugh at thee, or
      mimic thee, or criticise thee. Tha then loses for a song the respect due
      thy family, thy money, or thy real talents. Singing men aren&rsquo;t money men.
      Mind what I say! It is true as can be, dear lad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is the way father spoke to me and I promised him I would never sing
      again except for my family and nearest friends. De Burg was not my friend
      and I felt at once that if I sang for him I would give him opportunities
      to say something unpleasant about me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leyland laughed very understandingly. &ldquo;You have given me a powerful
      weapon, Harry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;How did you feel when De Burg sang?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt glad. I thought he looked very silly. I wondered if he had ever
      practiced before a looking-glass. O Leyland, I felt a great many scornful
      and unkind things; and I felt above all how right and proper my father&rsquo;s
      judgment was&mdash;that men who condescend to amuse and especially to
      provoke laughter or buffoonery will never be the men who rule or lead
      other men. Even more strongly than this, I felt that the social reputation
      of being a fine singer would add no good thing to my business reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Harry. It is not the song singers of England who are
      building factories and making railroads and who are seeking and finding
      out new ways to make steam their servant. Your father gave you excellent
      advice, my own feelings and experience warrant him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father is a wise, brave-hearted man,&rdquo; said Harry proudly, and
      Katherine clasped his hand in sweet accord, as he said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Harry occupied his little room on the third floor in Leyland&rsquo;s
      house and the happy sleeping place was full of dreams of Katherine. He
      awakened from them as we do from fortunate dreams, buoyant with courage
      and hope, and sure of love&rsquo;s and life&rsquo;s final victory and happiness:
    </p>

    <p class="indent20">
      Then it does not seem miles,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Out to the emerald isles,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Set in the shining smiles,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Of Love&rsquo;s blue sea.

      <br />

    <p>
      Happy are the good sleepers and dreamers I Say that they spend nearly a
      third part of their lives in sleep, their sleeping hours <i>are not dead
      hours</i>. Their intellects are awake, their unconscious self is busy. In
      reality we always dream, but many do not remember their dreams any more
      than they remember the thoughts that have passed through their minds
      during the day. Real dreams are rare. They come of design. They are never
      forgotten. They are always helpful because the incompleteness of this life
      asks for a larger theory than the material needs&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      A deep below the deep,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">

    <p class="indent20">
      For our hearing is not hearing,

    <p class="indent30">
      And our seeing is not sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry had been wonderfully helped by his dreamful sleep. If he had been at
      home he would have sung all the time he dressed himself. He remembered
      that his father often did so but he did not connect that fact with one
      that was equally evident&mdash;that his father was a great dreamer. It is
      so easy to be forgetful and even ungrateful for favors that minister to
      the spiritual rather than the material side of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he went downstairs softly humming to himself some joyous melody, he
      knew not what it was. Katherine was in the breakfast room and heard him
      coming, timing his footsteps to the music his heart was almost whispering
      on his lips. So when he opened the door he saw her standing expectant of
      his entrance and he uttered an untranslatable cry of joy. She was standing
      by the breakfast table making coffee and she said, &ldquo;Good morning, Harry!
      Jane is not down yet. Shall I serve you until she comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall walk all day in the clouds if you serve me.
      Nothing could be more delightful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it fell out that they breakfasted at once, and Love sat down between
      them. And all that day, Harry ate, and talked, and walked, and did his
      daily work to the happy, happy song in his heart&mdash;the song he had
      brought back from the Land of Dreams.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T is not necessary
      for me to describe the formal introduction of Katherine to London society.
      A large number of my readers may have a personal experience of that
      uncertain step, which Longfellow says, the brook takes into the river,
      affirming also that it is taken &ldquo;with reluctant feet&rdquo;; but Longfellow must
      be accepted with reservations. Most girls have all the pluck and courage
      necessary for that leap into the dark and Katherine belonged to this
      larger class. She felt the constraints of the upper social life. She was
      ready for the event and wished it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire also wished it over. He could not help an uneasy regret about
      the days and the money spent in preparing for its few hours of what seemed
      to him unnecessary entertaining; not even free from the possibility of
      being rudely broken up&mdash;the illuminated house, the adjoining streets
      filled with vehicles, the glimpses of jewelry and of rich clothing as the
      guests left their carriages; the sounds of music&mdash;the very odors of
      cooking from the open windows of the kitchens&mdash;the calls of footmen&mdash;all
      the stir of revelry and all the paraphernalia of luxury. How would the
      hungry, angry, starving men gathering all over London take this spectacle?
      The squire feared there would be some demonstration and if it should be
      made against his family&rsquo;s unfeeling extravagance how could he bear it? He
      knew that Englishmen usually,
    </p>

    <p class="indent20">
      Through good and evil stand,

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knew also, that Hunger knows no law, and that men too poor to have
      where to lay their heads do not have much care regarding the heads of more
      fortunate men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Squire Annis was a thoroughly informed man on all historical and political
      subjects and he knew well that the English people had not been so much in
      earnest since the time of Oliver Cromwell as they then were; and when he
      called to remembrance the events between the rejection of the first Reform
      Bill and its present struggle, he was really amazed that people could
      think or talk of any other thing. Continually he was arranging in his mind
      the salient points of moral dispute, as he had known them, and it may not
      be amiss for two or three minutes to follow his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      They generally went back to the dramatic rejection of the first Reform
      Bill, on the sixteenth of August, A. D. 1831. Parliament met again on the
      sixth of December, and on the twelfth of December Lord John Russell
      brought in a second Reform Bill. It was slightly changed but in all
      important matters the same as the first Bill. On the eighteenth of
      December, Parliament adjourned for the Christmas holidays but met again on
      January the seventeenth, A. D. 1832. This Parliament passed The Bill ready
      for the House of Lords on March the twenty-sixth, just two days after his
      own arrival in London. He had made a point of seeing this ceremony, for a
      very large attendance of peeresses and strangers of mark were expected to
      be present. He found the space allotted to strangers crowded, but he also
      found a good standing place and from it saw the Lord Chancellor Brougham
      take his seat at the Woolsack and the Deputy usher of the Black Rod
      announce&mdash;&ldquo;A message from the Commons.&rdquo; Then he saw the doors thrown
      open and Lord Althorp and Lord John Russell, bearing the Reform Bill in
      their hands, appeared at the head of one hundred members of Parliament,
      and Russell delivered the Bill to the Lord Chancellor, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lords, the House of Commons have passed an act to amend the
      representation of England and Wales to which they desire your Lordship&rsquo;s
      concurrence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great question now was, whether the Lords would concur or not, for if
      the populace were ready to back their determination with their lives the
      Lords were in the same temper though they knew well enough that the one
      stubborn cry of the whole country was &ldquo;The Bill, The Bill, and nothing but
      The Bill.&rdquo; They knew also that The House of Commons sympathized with the
      suffering of the poor and the terrible deeds of the French Revolution were
      still green in their memories. Yet they dared to argue and dispute and put
      off the men standing in dangerous patience, waiting, waiting day and night
      for justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past week, also, all thoughtful persons had been conscious of a
      change in these waiting men, a change which Lord Grey told The Commons was
      &ldquo;to be regarded as ominous and dangerous.&rdquo; It was, that the crowds
      everywhere had become portentously silent. They no longer discussed the
      subject. They had no more to say. They were now full ready to do all their
      powerful Political Unions threatened. These unions were prepared to march
      to London and bivouac in its squares. The powerful Birmingham Union
      declared &ldquo;two hundred thousand men were ready to leave their forges and
      shops, encamp on Hampstead Heath, and if The Bill did not speedily become
      a law, compel that event to take place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this time also, violent expressions had become common in The House.
      Members spoke with the utmost freedom about a fighting duke, and a
      military government, and the Duke of Wellington was said to have pledged
      himself to the King to quiet the country, if necessary, in ten days. It
      was also asserted that, at his orders, the Scots Greys had been employed
      on a previous Sabbath Day in grinding their swords.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if,&rdquo; cried the press and the people as with one voice, &ldquo;as if
      Englishmen could be kept from their purpose by swords and bayonets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this period the King was obstinate and ill-tempered and so
      ignorant about the character of the people he had been set to govern, as
      to think their sudden quietness predicted their submission; though Lord
      Grey had particularly warned the Lords against this false idea. &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo;
       he virtually said, &ldquo;we have not heard for a few days the thrilling
      outcries of a desperate crowd of angry suffering men but I warn you, my
      Lords, to take no comfort on that account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Englishmen are ready to fight they don&rsquo;t scream about it but their
      weapons are drawn and they are prepared to strike. The great body of
      Englishmen did not consider these poor, unlettered men were any less
      English men than themselves. They knew them to be of the same class and
      kidney, as fought with Cromwell, Drake, and Nelson, and which made
      Wellington victorious; they knew that neither the men who wielded the big
      hammers at the forges of Birmingham, nor the men who controlled steam, nor
      the men that brought up coal from a thousand feet below sight and light,
      nor yet the men who plowed the ground would hesitate much longer to fight
      for their rights; for there was not now a man in all England who was not
      determined to be a recognized citizen of the land he loved and was always
      ready to fight for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sentiments like these could not fall from the lips of such men as Grey and
      Brougham without having great influence; and in the soul of Antony Annis
      they were echoing with potent effect, whatever he did, or wherever he
      went. For he was really a man of fine moral and intellectual nature, who
      had lived too much in his own easy, simple surroundings, and who had been
      suddenly and roughly awakened to great public events. And, oh, how quickly
      they were rubbing the rust from his unused talents and feelings!
    </p>
    <p>
      He missed his wife&rsquo;s company much at this time, for when he was in The
      House he could not have it and when he got back to the hotel Annie was
      seldom there. She was with Jane or Josepha, and her interests at this
      period were completely centered on her daughter Katherine. So Annis,
      especially during the last week, had felt himself neglected; he could get
      his wife to talk of nothing but Katherine, and her dress, and the
      preparations Jane was making to honor the beauty&rsquo;s début.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, just now he wanted above all other comforts his wife&rsquo;s company and on
      the afternoon of the day before the entertainment was to take place he was
      determined to have it, even if he had to go to Jane&rsquo;s or Josepha&rsquo;s house
      to get what he wished. Greatly to his satisfaction he found her in the
      dressing-room of her hotel apartments. She had been trying on her own new
      dress for the great occasion and seemed to be much pleased and in very
      good spirits; but the squire&rsquo;s anxious mood quickly made itself felt and
      after a few ineffectual trials to raise her husband&rsquo;s spirits, she said,
      with just a touch of irritability:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is the matter with thee, Antony? I suppose it is that wearisome
      Bill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annie, however wearisome it is we aren&rsquo;t done with it yet, mebbe we
      hev only begun its quarrel. The Whole country is in a bad way and I do
      wonder how tha can be so taken up with the thoughts of dressing and
      dancing. I will tell thee one thing, I am feared for the sound of music
      and merry-making in any house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never before knew that Antony Annis was cowardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thee say words like them to me, Annie. I will not hev them. And I
      think thou hes treated me varry badly indeed iver since we came here. I
      thought I would allays be sure of thy company and loving help and thou hes
      disappointed me. Thou hes that. Yet all my worry hes been about thee and
      Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou has not shown any care about either of us. Thou has hardly been at
      thy home here for ten days; and thou has not asked a question about
      Kitty&rsquo;s plans and dress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, I was thinking of her life and of thy life, too. I was
      wondering how these angry, hungry men, filling the streets of London will
      like the sight and sounds of music and dancing while they are starving and
      fainting in our varry sight. I saw a man fall down through hunger
      yesterday, and I saw two men, early this morning, helping one another to
      stagger to a bench in the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll warrant thou helped them to a cup of coffee and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I did! Does tha think thy husband, Antony Annis, is without
      feeling as well as without courage! I am afraid for thee and for all women
      who can&rsquo;t see and feel that the riot and bloodshed that took place not
      long ago in Bristol can be started here in London any moment by some
      foolish word or act. And I want thee to know if tha doesn&rsquo;t already know,
      that this new disease, that no doctor understands or ever saw before, hes
      reached London. It came to Bristol while the city was burning, it came
      like a blow from the hand of God, and every physician is appalled by it. A
      man goes out and is smitten, and never comes home again, and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
      Annie! Annie! I cannot bear it! There will be-some tragedy&mdash;and it is
      for thee and Kitty I fear&mdash;not for mysen, oh no!&rdquo; And he leaned his
      elbows on the chimney piece and buried his face in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Annie went swiftly to his side, and in low, sweet, cooing words said,
      &ldquo;Oh, my love! My husband! Oh, my dear Antony, if tha hed only told me thy
      fears and thy sorrow, I could hev cleared thy mind a bit. Sit thee down
      beside me and listen to what thy Annie can tell thee.&rdquo; Then she kissed him
      and took his hands in her hands, and led him to his chair and drew her own
      chair close to his side and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew, my dear one, that thou was bothered in thy mind and that thy
      thoughts were on Bristol and other places that hev been fired by the
      rioters; and I wanted to tell thee of something that happened more than a
      week ago. Dost thou remember a girl called Sarah Sykes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do that&mdash;a varry big, clumsy lass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind her looks. When Josepha was at Annis last summer she noticed
      how much the girl was neglected and she took her part with her usual
      temper, gave her nice clothes, and told her she would find something for
      her to do in London. So when we were all very busy and I was tired out,
      Josepha sent her a pound and bid her come to us as quick as she could.
      Well, the first thing we knew the lass was in Jane&rsquo;s house and she soon
      found out that Joshua Swale was the leader of the crowd that are mostly
      about the Crescent where it stands. And it wasn&rsquo;t long before Sarah had
      told Israel all thou hed done and all thou was still doing for thy
      weavers; and then a man, who had come from the little place where thou
      left a ten-pound note, told of that and of many other of thy kind deeds,
      and so we found out that thy name stood very high among all the Political
      Unions; and that these Unions have made themselves well acquainted with
      the sayings and doings of all the old hand loom employers; and are
      watching them closely, as to how they are treating their men, and if any
      are in The House, how they are voting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish thou hed told me this when thou first heard it. I wonder thou
      didn&rsquo;t do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I could have managed a quiet talk with thee I would have done that;
      but thou has lived in The House of Commons all of the last week, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And been varry anxious and unhappy, Annie. Let me tell thee that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, dearie, happiness is a domestic pleasure. Few people find her
      often outside their own home. Do they, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My duty took me away from thee and my own home. There hev been constant
      night sessions for the last week and more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, and it has been close to sun-up when thou tumbled sleepy and
      weary into thy bed. And I couldn&rsquo;t wait until thou got thy senses again. I
      hed to go with Josepha about something or other, or I had to help Jane
      with her preparations, and so the days went by. Then, also, when I did get
      a sight of thee, thou could not frame thysen to talk of anything but that
      weary Bill and it made me cross. I thought thou ought to care a little
      about Katherine&rsquo;s affairs, they were as important to her as The Bill was
      to thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was caring, Annie. I was full of care and worry about Kitty. I was
      that. And I needn&rsquo;t hev been so miserable if thou hed cared for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, I was cross enough to say to myself, &lsquo;Antony can just tell
      his worries to The Bill men and I&rsquo;ll be bound he does.&rsquo; So he got no
      chance for a good talk and I didn&rsquo;t let Sarah Sykes trouble my mind at
      all; but I can tell thee that all thy goodness to the Annis weavers is
      written down on their hearts, and thou and thine are safe whatever
      happens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thankful for thy words. Will tha sit an hour with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not leave thee to-night if thou wants to talk to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my joy! How good thou art! There is not a woman in England to marrow
      thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come then to the parlor and we will have a cup of tea and thou will tell
      me all thy fears about The Bill and I&rsquo;ll sit with thee until thou wants to
      go back to The House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So he kissed her and told her again how dear she was to him and how much
      he relied on her judgment, and they went to the parlor like lovers, or
      like something far better. For if they had been only lovers, they could
      not have known the sweetness, and strength, and unity of a married love
      twenty-six years old. And as they drank their tea, Annis made clear to his
      wife the condition of affairs in The Commons, and she quickly became as
      much interested in the debate going on as himself. &ldquo;It hes been going on
      now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for three nights, and will probably continue all this
      night and mebbe longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then will it be settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is settled, Annie, till it is settled right, and if The Commons
      settle it right the lords may turn it out altogether again&mdash;<i>if
      they dare</i>. However, thou hes given me a far lighter heart and I&rsquo;ll
      mebbe hev a word or two to say mysen to-night, for the question of
      workmen&rsquo;s wages is coming up and I&rsquo;d like to give them my opinion on that
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a good thing if the government fixed the wages of the
      workers. It might put a stop to strikes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not it! Workingmen&rsquo;s wages are as much beyond the control of government
      as the fogs of the Atlantic. Who can prevent contractors from underselling
      one another? Who can prevent workmen from preferring starvation wages,
      rather than no wages at all? The man who labors knows best what his work
      is worth and you can&rsquo;t blame him for demanding what is just and fair.
      Right is right in the devil&rsquo;s teeth. If you talk forever, you&rsquo;ll niver get
      any forrarder than that; but I have always noticed that when bad becomes
      bad enough, right returns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The last time we talked about The Bill, Antony, you said you were anxious
      that the Scotch Bill should take exactly the same position that the
      English Bill does. Will the Scotch do as you wish them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to get a Scotchman to confess that he is oppressed by anyone,
      or by any law. He doesn&rsquo;t mind admitting a sentimental grievance about the
      place that the lion hes on the flag; but he&rsquo;s far too proud to allow that
      anything wrong with the conditions of life is permissible in Scotland. Yet
      there are more socialists in Scotland than anywhere else, which I take as
      a proof that they are as dissatisfied as any other workingmen are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it that the socialists are continually talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are talking about a world that does not exist, Annie, and that niver
      did exist, and promising us a world that couldn&rsquo;t by any possibility
      exist. But I&rsquo;ll tell thee what I hev found out just since I came here;
      that is, that if we are going to continue a Protective Government we&rsquo;re
      bound to hev Socialism flourish. Let England stop running a government to
      protect rich and noble land owners, let her open her ports and give us
      Free Trade, and we&rsquo;ll hear varry little more of socialism.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you go to The House to-night, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t miss going for a good deal. Last night&rsquo;s session did not close
      till daylight and I&rsquo;ll niver forget as long as I live the look of The
      House at that time. Grey had been speaking for an hour and a half, though
      he is now in his sixty-eighth year; and I could not help remembering that
      forty years previously, he had stood in the same place, pleading for the
      same Bill, Grey being at that date both its author and its advocate. My
      father was in The House then and I hev often heard him tell how Lord
      Wharncliffe moved that Grey&rsquo;s Reform Bill should be rejected altogether;
      and how Lord Brougham made one of the grandest speeches of his life in its
      favor, ending it with an indescribable relation of the Sybil&rsquo;s offer to
      old Rome. Now, Annie, I want to see the harvest of that seed sowed by Grey
      and Brougham forty years ago, and that harvest may come to-night. Thou
      wouldn&rsquo;t want me to miss it, would thou?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would be very sorry indeed if thou missed it; but what about the
      Sybil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why-a! this old Roman prophetess was called up by Brougham to tell
      England the price she would hev to pay if her rulers persisted in their
      abominable husbandry of sowing injustice and reaping rebellion. &lsquo;Hear the
      parable of the Sybil!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;She is now at your gate, and she offers
      you in this Bill wisdom and peace. The price she asks is reasonable; it is
      to restore the franchise, which you ought voluntarily to give. You refuse
      her terms and she goes away. But soon you find you cannot do without her
      wares and you call her back. Again she comes but with diminished treasures&mdash;the
      leaves of the book are partly torn away by lawless hands, and in part
      defaced with characters of blood. But the prophetic maid has risen in her
      demands&mdash;it is Parliament by the year&mdash;it is vote by the ballot&mdash;it
      is suffrage by the million now. From this you turn away indignant, and for
      the second time she departs. Beware of her third coming, for the treasure
      you must have, and who shall tell what price she may demand? It may even
      be the mace which rests upon that woolsack. Justice deferred enhances the
      price you must pay for peace and safety and you cannot expect any other
      crop than they had who went before you and who, in their abominable
      husbandry, sowed injustice and reaped rebellion.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Antony was declaiming the last passages of this speech when the door
      opened and Mrs. Temple entered. She sat down and waited until her brother
      ceased, then she said with enthusiasm:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well done, Antony! If thou must quote from somebody&rsquo;s fine orations,
      Brougham and the Sybil woman were about the best thou could get, if so be
      thou did not go to the Scriptures. In that book thou would find all that
      it is possible for letters and tongues to say against the men who oppress
      the poor, or do them any injustice; and if I wanted to make a speech that
      would beat Brougham&rsquo;s to a disorganized alphabet, I&rsquo;d take ivery word of
      it out of the sacred Scriptures. I would that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Josepha, I hope I may see The Bill pass the Commons to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou hes more to wish for than to hope for. Does Brougham and
      Palmerston iver speak to each other now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is as much as they can do to lift their hats. They niver speak, I
      think. Why do you ask me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I heard one water man say to another, as I was taking a boat at
      my awn water house&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If the Devil hes a son,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Then his name is Palmerston.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such rhymes against a man do him a deal of harm, Josepha. The rhyme
      sticks and fastens, whether it be true or false, but there is nothing
      beats a mocking, scornful story for cutting nation wide and living for
      centuries after it. That rhyme about Palmerston will not outlive him in
      any popular sense, but the mocking scornful story through which Canon
      Sydney Smith of St. Paul&rsquo;s derided the imbecility of The Lords will live
      as long as English history lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not remember that story, Antony. Do you, Josepha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I remember it; but I&rsquo;ll let Antony tell it to thee and then thou will
      be sure to store it up as something worth keeping. What I tell thee hes
      not the same power of sticking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It may be that you are right, Josepha. Men do speak with more authority
      than women do. What did Canon Sydney Smith say, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said the attempt of the Lords to stop Reform reminded him of the great
      storm at Sidmouth and of the conduct of Mrs. Partington on that occasion.
      Six or seven winters ago there was a great storm upon that town, the tide
      rose to an incredible height, and the waves rushed in upon the beach, and
      in the midst of this terrible storm she was seen at the door of her house
      with her dress pinned up, and her highest pattens on her feet, trundling
      her mop, squeezing out the sea water, and vigorously pushing away the
      Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean was roused. Mrs. Partington&rsquo;s spirit
      was up, but I need not tell you the contest was unequal. The Atlantic
      Ocean beat Mrs. Partington. You see, Annie, the Canon really compared the
      Lords to a silly old woman and all England that were not in the House of
      Lords screamed with laughter. In that day, The House of Lords lost more of
      its dignity and prestige than it has yet regained; and Mrs. Partington did
      far more for Reform than all the fine speeches that were made.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie,&rdquo; said Josepha, &ldquo;we may as well take notice that it was a woman who
      went, or was sent, to the old Roman world with the laws of justice and
      peace; and Sydney Smith knew enough about Reform to be aware it would be
      best forwarded by putting his parable in the pluck and spirit of Dame
      Partington. It seems, then, that both in the old and the present world,
      there were men well aware of womanly influence in politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dear women, I must away. I want to be in at the finish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing will finish to-night. And thou will lose thy sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I lost it last night. The day was breaking when I left The House. The
      candles had been renewed just before daylight and were blazing on after
      the sunshine came in at the high windows, making a varry singular effect
      on their crimson draperies and on the dusky tapestries on the wall. I may
      be as late home to-morrow morning. Good night!&rdquo; and he bent and kissed
      both ladies, and then hurried away, anxious and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the women were silent a moment watching him out of sight in the twilight
      and then softly praising his beauty, manliness, and his loving nature. On
      this subject Annie and Josepha usually agreed, though at last Josepha said
      with a sigh&mdash;&ldquo;It is a pity, however, that his purse strings are so
      loose. He spends a lot of money.&rdquo; And Annie replied: &ldquo;Perhaps so, but he
      is such a good man I had forgotten that he had a fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And as a politician it is very eccentric&mdash;not to say foolish&mdash;for
      him to vote for justice and principle, not to speak of feelings, instead
      of party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If those things in any shape are faults, I am glad he has them. I could
      not yet live with a perfect man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose thou could. It would be a bit beyond thee. Is all ready
      for to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I have lost heart on the subject. Are you going to Jane&rsquo;s now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may do that. I heard that Agatha De Burg was home and I would like to
      warn Katherine to take care of every word she says in Agatha&rsquo;s presence.
      She tells all she hears to that cousin of hers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen De Burg lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three times at Jane&rsquo;s house. He seems quite at home there now. He
      is very handsome, and graceful, and has such fine manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I hev no more to say and it is too late for me to take the water way
      home. Will tha order me a carriage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie&rsquo;s readiness to fulfill this request did not please Josepha and she
      stood at the window and was nearly silent until she saw a carriage stop at
      the hotel door. Then she said, &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll go and see if Jane hes
      anything like a welcome to offer me. Good-by to thee, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall see you early to-morrow, I hope, Josepha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, thou hopes for nothing of that kind but I&rsquo;ll be at Jane&rsquo;s
      sometime before I am wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should not say such unkind words, Josepha. You are always welcome
      wherever you go. In some way I have lost myself the last ten minutes. I do
      not feel all here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou hed better try and find thysen. Thou wilt need all there is of
      thee to bother with Antony about t&rsquo; House of Commons, and to answer
      civilly the crowd of strangers that will come to see thy daughter
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is neither the Bill nor the strangers that trouble me. My vexations
      lie nearer home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must say that thou ought to hev learned how to manage them by this
      time. It is all of twenty-seven years since Antony married thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not Antony. Antony has not a fault. Not one!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad thou hes found that out at last. Well, the carriage is waiting
      and I&rsquo;ll bid thee good-bye; and I hope thou may get thysen all together
      before to-morrow at this time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words Josepha went and Annie threw herself into her chair with
      a sense of relief. &ldquo;I know she intended to stay for dinner,&rdquo; she mentally
      complained, &ldquo;and I could not bear her to-night. She is too overflowing&mdash;she
      is too much every way. I bless myself for my patience for twenty-seven
      years. Is it really twenty-seven years?&rdquo; And with this last suggestion she
      lost all consciousness of the present hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Josepha was not thinking any flattering things of her
      sister-in-law. &ldquo;She wanted me to go away! What a selfish, cross woman she
      is! Poor Antony! I wonder how he bears her,&rdquo; and in a mood of such
      complaining, Josepha with all her kindly gossiping hopes dashed, went
      almost tearfully home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annie, however, was not cross. She was feeling with her husband the
      gravity of public affairs and was full of anxious speculation concerning
      Katherine. A change had come over the simple, beautiful girl. Without
      being in the least disobedient or disrespectful, she had shown in late
      days a thoroughly natural and full grown Annis temper. No girl ever knew
      better just what she wanted and no girl ever more effectually arranged
      matters in such wise as would best secure her all she wanted. About Harry
      Bradley she had not given way one hair&rsquo;s breadth, and yet evidently her
      father was as far as ever from bearing the thought of Harry as a
      son-in-law. His kindness to him in the weaving shop was founded initially
      on his appreciation of good work and of a clever business tactic and he
      was also taken by surprise, and so easily gave in to the old trick of
      liking the lad. But he was angry at himself for having been so weak and he
      felt that in some way Harry had bested him, and compelled him to break the
      promises he had made to himself regarding both the young man and his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a couple of hours these subjects occupied her completely, then she
      rose and went to her room and put away her new gown. It was a perfectly
      plain one of fawn-colored brocade with which she intended to wear her
      beautiful old English laces. As she was performing this duty she thought
      about her own youth. It had been a very commonplace one, full of small
      economies. She had never had a formal &ldquo;coming out,&rdquo; and being the eldest
      of five girls she had helped her mother to manage a household, constantly
      living a little above its income. Yet she had many sweet, loving thoughts
      over this life; and before she was aware her cheeks were wet with tears,
      uncalled, but not unwelcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear mother,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;in what land of God art thou now
      resting? Surely thou art thinking of me! We are near to each other, though
      far, far apart. Now, then, I will do as thou used to advise, &lsquo;let worries
      alone, and don&rsquo;t worry over them.&rsquo; Some household angel will come and put
      everything right. Oh, mother of many sorrows, pray for me. Thou art nearer
      to God than I am.&rdquo; This good thought slipped through her tears like a soft
      strain of music, or a glint of sunshine, and she was strengthened and
      comforted. Then she washed her face and put on her evening cap and went to
      the parlor and ordered dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she sat down to her lonely meal the door was hastily opened, and
      Dick Annis and Harry Bradley entered. And oh! how glad she was to see
      them, to seat them at the table, and to plentifully feed the two hungry
      young men who had been traveling all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, wherever have you been, my dear lad? I hevn&rsquo;t had a letter from you
      since you were in Edinburgh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote you lots of letters, mother, but I had no way of posting them to
      you. After leaving Edinburgh we sailed northward to Lerwick and there I
      mailed you a long letter. It will be here in a few days, no doubt, but
      their mail boat only carries mail &lsquo;weather permitting,&rsquo; and after we left
      Lerwick, all the way to Aberdeen we had a roaring wind in our teeth. I
      don&rsquo;t think it was weather the ill-tempered Pentland Firth would permit
      mail to be carried over it. How is father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as he will be until the Reform Bill is passed. You are just in
      time for Katherine&rsquo;s party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I might be so, for father told me he was sure dress and
      mantua-makers would not have you ready for company in two weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father was right. We may get people to weave the cloth by steam but when
      it comes to sewing the cloth into clothes, there is nothing but fingers
      and needles and some woman&rsquo;s will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they talked of the preparations made and the guests that were
      expected, and the evening passed so pleasantly that it was near midnight
      when the youths went away. And before that time the squire had sent a note
      to his wife telling her he would not leave The House until the sitting
      broke up. This note was brought by a Commons Messenger, for the telegraph
      was yet a generation away.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mistress Annis slept well, and the next day broke in blue skies and
      sunshine. After breakfast was over she went to the Leyland Mansion to see
      if her help was required in any way. Not that she expected it, for she
      knew that Jane was far too good an organizer to be unready in any
      department. Indeed she found her leisurely drinking coffee and reading <i>The
      Court Circular</i>. Its news also had been gratifying, for she said to her
      mother as she laid down the paper, &ldquo;All is very satisfactory. There are no
      entertainments to-night that will interfere with mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was equally prepared but much more excited and that pleased her
      mother. She wished Katherine to keep her girlish enthusiasms and
      extravagant expectations as long as possible; Jane&rsquo;s composure and
      apparent indifference seemed to her unnatural and later she reflected that
      &ldquo;Jane used to flurry and worry more than enough. Why!&rdquo; she mentally
      exclaimed, &ldquo;I have not forgot how she routed us all out of our beds at
      five o&rsquo;clock on the morning of her wedding day, and was so nervous herself
      that she made the whole house restless as a whirlpool. But she says it is
      now fashionable to be serenely unaffected by any event, and whatever is
      the fashionable insanity, Jane is sure to be one of the first to catch
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion her whole household had been schooled to the same calm
      spirit, and while it had a decided air of festivity, there was also one of
      order, and of everything going on as it ought to do. No hurrying servants
      or belated confectionery vans impeded the guests&rsquo; arrival. The rooms were
      in perfect order. The dinner would be served at the minute specified, and
      the host and hostess were waiting to perform every hospitable duty with
      amiable precision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine did not enter the reception parlors until the dinner guests had
      arrived and expectation was at a pleasant point of excitement. Then the
      principal door was thrown open with obvious intent and Squire Annis and
      his family were very plainly announced. Katherine was walking between her
      father and mother, and Mrs. Josepha Temple, leaning on the arm of her
      favorite nephew Dick, was a few steps behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden silence, a quick assurance of the coming of Katherine,
      and immediately the lovely girl made a triumphant entry into their eyes
      and consciousness. She was dressed in white radiant gauze, * dotted with
      small silver stars. It fell from her belt to her feet without any break of
      its beauty by ruffle or frill. The waist slightly covered the shoulders,
      the sleeves were full and gathered into a band above the elbows. Both
      waist and sleeves were trimmed with lace traced out with silver thread,
      and edged with a thin silver cord. Her sandals were of white kid
      embroidered with silver stars, her gloves matched them. She was without
      jewelry of any kind, unless the wonderfully carved silver combs for the
      hair which Admiral Temple had brought from India can be so called. Thus
      clothed, all the mystery and beauty of the flesh was accentuated. Her fine
      eyes were soft and shining, with that happy surprise in them that belongs
      only to the young enthusiast, and yet her eyes were hardly more lambent
      than the rest of her face, for at this happy hour all the ancient ecstasy
      of Love and Youth transfigured her and she looked as if she had been born
      with a smile.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * An almost transparent material first made in Gaza,
     Palestine, from which it derived its name.
</pre>
    <p>
      Without intent Katherine&rsquo;s association with her father and mother greatly
      added to the impression she made. The squire was handsomely attired in a
      fashionable suit of dark blue broadcloth, trimmed with large gilt buttons,
      a white satin vest, and a neck piece of soft mull and English lace. And
      not less becoming to Katherine as a set off was her mother&rsquo;s plain, dark,
      emphatic costume. Yes, even the rather showy extravagance of the aunt as a
      background was an advantage, and could hardly have been better considered,
      for Madam Temple on this occasion had discarded her usual black garments
      and wore a purple velvet dress and all her wonderful diamonds. Consistent
      with this luxury, her laces were of old Venice <i>point de rose</i>,
      arranged back and front in a Vandyke collar with cuffs of the same lace,
      high as the elbows, giving a cachet to her whole attire, which did not
      seem to be out of place on a woman so erect and so dignified that she
      never touched the back of a chair, and with a temper so buoyant, so
      high-spirited, and so invincible.
    </p>
    <p>
      When dinner was served, Katherine noticed that neither De Burg nor Harry
      Bradley were at the table and after the meal she questioned her sister
      with some feeling about this omission. &ldquo;I do not mind De Burg&rsquo;s absence,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;he is as well away as not, but poor Harry, what has he done!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry is all right, Kitty, but we have to care for father&rsquo;s feelings
      first of all and you know he has no desire to break bread with Harry
      Bradley. <i>Why!</i> he considers &lsquo;by bread and salt&rsquo; almost a sacred
      obligation, and if he eats with Harry, he must give him his hand, his good
      will, and his help, when the occasion asks for it. Father would have felt
      it hard to forgive me if I had forced such an obligation on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And De Burg? Is he also beyond the bread and salt limit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe father might think so, but that is not the reason in his case.
      He sent an excuse for dinner but promised to join the dancers at ten
      o&rsquo;clock and to bring his cousin Agatha with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How interesting! We shall all be on the <i>qui-vive</i> for her début.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Kitty. And do not speak French, until you can speak it
      with a proper accent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no doubt it is good enough for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As for her début, it occurred six or seven years ago. Agatha had the run
      of society when you were in short frocks. Come, let us go to the ballroom.
      Your father is sure to be prompt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they reached the ballroom, they found Lord Leyland looking for
      Katherine. &ldquo;Father is waiting,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we have the quadrilles
      nearly set,&rdquo; and while Leyland was yet speaking, Squire Annis bowed to his
      daughter and she laid her hand in his with a smile, and they took the
      place Leyland indicated. At the same moment, Dick led his mother to a
      position facing them and there was not a young man or a young woman in the
      room who might not have learned something of grace and dignity from the
      dancing of the elderly handsome couple.
    </p>
    <p>
      After opening the ball the squire went to his place in The House of
      Commons and Madam went to the card room and sat down to a game of whist,
      having for her partner Alexander Macready, a prominent London banker. His
      son had been in the opening quadrille with Katherine and in a moment had
      fallen in love with her. Moreover, it was a real passion, timid yet full
      of ardor, sincere, or else foolishly talkative, and Katherine felt him to
      be a great encumbrance. Wearily listening to his platitudes of admiration,
      she saw Harry Bradley and De Burg and his cousin enter. Harry was really
      foremost, but courtesy compelled him for the lady&rsquo;s sake to give
      precedence to De Burg and his cousin; consequently they reached
      Katherine&rsquo;s side first. But Katherine&rsquo;s eyes, full of love&rsquo;s happy
      expectation, looked beyond them, and Miss De Burg saw in their expression
      Katherine&rsquo;s preference for the man behind her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen need not think himself first,&rdquo; she instantly decided, &ldquo;this new
      girl was watching for the man Stephen put back. A handsome man! He&rsquo;ll get
      ahead yet! He&rsquo;s made that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Lady Leyland joined them and De Burg detained her as long as
      possible, delighting himself with the thought of Harry&rsquo;s impatience. When
      they moved forward he explained his motive and laughed a little over it;
      but Agatha quickly damped his self-congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stephen,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the young man waiting was not at all uncomfortable.
      I saw Miss Annis give him her hand and also a look that some men would
      gladly wait a day for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Gath, I saw nothing of the kind. You are mistaken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were too much occupied in reciting to her the little speech you had
      composed for the occasion. You know! I heard you saying it over and over,
      as you walked about your room last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a woman you are! You hear and see everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I am not wanted to hear and see, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In this house I want you to see and hear all you can. What do you think
      of the young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I think of her at all?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For my sake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That plea is worn out.&rdquo; She smiled as she spoke and then some exigency of
      the ball separated them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss De Burg was not a pretty woman and yet people generally looked twice
      at her. She had a cold, washed-out face, a great deal of very pale brown
      hair and her hair, eyebrows, and eyes were all the same color. There was
      usually <i>no look</i> in her eyes and her mouth told nothing. It was a
      firm and silent mouth and if her face had any expression it was one of
      reserve or endurance. And Katherine in the very flush of her own happy
      excitement divined some tragedy below this speechless face, and she held
      Agatha&rsquo;s hand and looked into her eyes with that sympathy which is one of
      youth&rsquo;s kindest moods. This feeling hesitated a moment between the two
      women; then Agatha surrendered, and took it into her heart and memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now balls are so common and so natural an expression of humanity that they
      possess both its sameness and its variability. They are all alike and all
      different, all alike in action, all different in the actors; and the only
      importance of this ball to Katherine Annis was that it introduced her to
      the mere physical happiness that flows from fresh and happy youth. In this
      respect it was perhaps the high tide of her life. The beautiful room, the
      mellow transfiguring light of wax candles, the gayly gowned company, the
      intoxicating strains of music, and the delight of her motion to it, the
      sense of her loveliness, and of the admiration it brought, made her heart
      beat high and joyfully, and gave to her light steps a living grace no
      artist ever yet copied. She was queen of that company and took out what
      lovers she wished with a pretty despotism impossible to describe; but

    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And ere anyone had asked &ldquo;What time is it?&rdquo; daylight was stealing into the
      candle light and then there was only the cheerful hurry of cloaking and
      parting left, and the long-looked-for happiness was over. Yet after all it
      was a day by itself and the dower of To-morrow can never be weighed by the
      gauge of Yesterday.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;IN THE FOURTH WATCH
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ADY LEYLAND had
      ordered breakfast at ten o&rsquo;clock and at that hour her guests were ready
      for it. Mistress Temple and Katherine showed no signs of weariness, but
      Lord Ley-land looked bored and Mistress Annis was silent concerning the
      squire and his manner of passing the night. Then Leyland said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By George! Madam, you are very right to be anxious. The company of ladies
      always makes me anxious. I will go to my club and read the papers. I feel
      that delay is no longer possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your breakfast, Fred,&rdquo; cried Katherine, but Fred was as one that heard
      not, and with a smile and a good-by which included all present, Leyland
      disappeared, and as his wife smilingly endorsed his
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Love puts out all other cares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and anxious but soon voiced her trouble in a wish forget everything else
      but now if I can be excused apologies, no one made the slightest attempt
      to detain him. Certainly Mistress Annis looked curiously at her daughter
      and, when the door was closed, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder at you, Jane&mdash;Leyland had not drank his first cup of coffee
      and as to his breakfast it is still on his plate. It is not good for a man
      to go to politics fasting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O mother! you need not worry about Fred&rsquo;s breakfast. He will order one
      exactly to his mind as soon as he reaches his club and he will be ten
      times happier with the newspapers than with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just at this point the squire and his son entered the room together and
      instantly the social temperature of the place rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Leyland running away from you women,&rdquo; said the squire. &ldquo;Whatever
      hev you been doing to him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted to see the papers, father,&rdquo; said Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a bit of bad behavior,&rdquo; said Madam Temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no,&rdquo; Jane replied. &ldquo;Fred is incapable of anything so vulgar. Is
      he not, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure he is. No doubt it was a bit of fine feeling for the women
      present that sent him off. He knew you would want to discuss the affair of
      last night and also the people mixed up in it and he felt he would be in
      everybody&rsquo;s way, and so he was good-natured enough to leave you to the
      pleasure of describing one another. It was varry agreeable and polite for
      Fred to do so. I hedn&rsquo;t sense enough to do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, Antony, that isn&rsquo;t the way to put it. Dick, my dear lad, say a
      word for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not say a word worthy of you, mother, and now I came to bid you
      good-by. I am off as quick as possible for Annis. Father had a letter from
      Mr. Foster this morning. It is best that either father or I go there for a
      few days and, as father cannot leave London at this crisis, I am going in
      his place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter now, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some trouble with the weavers, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course! and more money needed, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; answered the squire, with a shade of temper; &ldquo;and if needed,
      Dick will look after it, eh, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course Dick will look after it!&rdquo; added Madam Temple, but her &ldquo;of
      course&rdquo; intimated a very different meaning from her sister-in-law&rsquo;s. They
      were two words of hearty sympathy and she emphasized them by pushing a
      heavy purse across the table. &ldquo;Take my purse as well as thy father&rsquo;s,
      Dick; and if more is wanted, thou can hev it, and welcome. I am Annis
      mysen and I was born and brought up with the men and women suffering
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She spoke with such feeling that her words appeared to warm the room and
      the squire answered: &ldquo;Thy word and deed, Josepha, is just like thee, my
      dear sister!&rdquo; He clasped her hand as he spoke, and their hands met over
      the purse lying on the table and both noticed the fact and smiled and
      nodded their understanding of it. Then the squire with a happy face handed
      the purse to Dick, telling him to &ldquo;kiss his mother,&rdquo; and be off as soon as
      possible. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he said in a voice full of tears&mdash;&ldquo;Dick, my lad, it
      is hard for hungry men to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will waste no time, father, not a minute,&rdquo; and with these words he
      clasped his father&rsquo;s hand, leaned over and kissed his mother, and with a
      general good-by he went swiftly on his errand of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jane said: &ldquo;Let us go to the parlor. We were an hour later than usual
      this morning and must make it up if we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, Jane,&rdquo; answered Mistress Temple. &ldquo;We can talk as well in one
      room as another. Houses must be kept regular or we shall get into the same
      muddle as old Sarum&mdash;we shall be candidates for dinner and no dinner
      for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you will all excuse me an hour while I give some orders about
      household affairs.&rdquo; The excuse was readily admitted and the squire, his
      wife, sister and daughter, took up the question which would intrude into
      every other question whether they wished it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
      The parlor to which they went looked precisely as if it was glad to see
      them; it was so bright and cheerful, so warm and sunny, so everything that
      the English mean by the good word &ldquo;comfortable.&rdquo; And as soon as they were
      seated, Annie asked: &ldquo;What about The Bill, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dearie, The Bill passed its third reading at seven o&rsquo;clock this
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou saw it pass, eh, Antony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That I did! <i>Why-a!</i> I wouldn&rsquo;t hev missed Lord Grey&rsquo;s final speech
      for anything. He began it at five o&rsquo;clock and spoke for an hour and a half&mdash;which
      considering his great age and the long night&rsquo;s strain was an astonishing
      thing to do. I was feeling a bit tired mysen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But surely the people took its passing very coldly, Antony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The people aren&rsquo;t going to shout till they are sure they hev something to
      shout for. Nobody knows what changes the lords may make in it. They may
      even throw it out again altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>They dare not! They dare not for their lives</i> try any more such
      foolishness,&rdquo; said Josepha Temple with a passion she hardly restrained.
      &ldquo;Just let them try it! The people will not allow that step any more! Let
      them try it! They will quickly see and feel what will come of such folly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Josepha, what will come of it? What can the people do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Iverything they want to do! Iverything they ought to do! One thing is
      sure&mdash;they will send the foreigners back to where they belong. The
      very kith and kin of the people now demanding their rights founded, not
      many generations ago, a glorious Republic of their own, and they gave
      themsens all the rights they wanted and allays put the man of their choice
      at the head of it. Do you think our people don&rsquo;t know what their fathers
      hev done before them? They know it well. They see for themsens that varry
      common men can outrank noble men when it comes to intellect and courage.
      What was it that Scotch plowboy said:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;A king can mak&rsquo; a belted knight,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      A marquis, duke and a&rsquo; that,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      But an honest man&rsquo;s aboon his might&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and a God&rsquo;s mercy it is, for if he tried it, he would waste and spoil the
      best of materials in the making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All such talk is sheer nonsense, Josepha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nothing of the kind. Josepha has seen how such sheer nonsense turns
      out. I should think thou could remember what happened fifty years ago.
      People laughed then at the sheer nonsense of thirteen little colonies in
      the wilds of America trying to make England give them exactly what
      Englishmen are this very day ready to fight for&mdash; representation in
      parliament. And you need not forget this fact also, that the majority of
      Englishmen at that day, both in parliament and out of it, backed with all
      the power they hed these thirteen little colonies. Why, the poor button
      makers of Sheffield refused to make buttons for the soldiers&rsquo; coats, lest
      these soldiers should be sent to fight Englishmen. It was then all they
      could do but their children are now two hundred thousand strong, and king
      and parliament <i>hev</i> to consider them. They <i>hev to do it</i> or to
      take the consequences, Antony Annis! Your father was hand and purse with
      that crowd and I knew you would see things as they are sooner or later.
      For our stock came from a poor, brave villager, who followed King Richard
      to the Crusades, and won the Annis lands for his courage and fidelity.
      That is why there is allays a Richard in an Annis household.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe all you say, Josepha, and our people, the rich and the poor,
      both believe it. They hev given the government ivery blessed chance to do
      fairly by them. Now, if it does so, well and good. If it does not do so,
      the people are full ready to make them do it. I can tell you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so tired of it all,&rdquo; said Annie wearily. &ldquo;Why do poor, uneducated
      men want to meddle with elections for parliament? I can understand and
      feel with them in their fight about their looms&mdash;it means their daily
      bread; but why should they care about the men who make our laws and that
      sort of business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee why. They hev to do it or else go on being poor and
      ignorant and of no account among men. Our laws are made to please the men
      who have a vote or a say-so in any election. The laboring men of England
      hev no vote at all. They can&rsquo;t say a word about their rights in the
      country for through the course of centuries the nobles and the rich men
      hev got all the votes in their awn pockets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe there is something right in that arrangement, Antony. They are
      better educated.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose that argument stood, Annie; still a poor man might like one rich
      man better than another, and he ought to be able to hev his chance for
      electing his choice; but that, however, is only the tag-end of the
      question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then what is the main end?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This:&mdash;In the course of centuries, places once of some account hev
      disappeared, as really as Babylon or Nineveh, and little villages hev
      grown to be big cities. There is no town of Sarum now, not a vestige, but
      the Chatham family represent it in parliament to-day or they sell the
      position or give it away. The member for the borough of Ludgershall is
      himself the only voter in the borough and he is now in parliament on his
      <i>awn</i> nomination. Another place has two members and only seven
      voters; and what do you think a foreigner visiting England would say when
      told that a green mound without a house on it sent two members to
      Parliament, or that a certain green park without an inhabitant also sent
      two members to Parliament? Then suppose him taken to Manchester, Bradford,
      Sheffield, and other great manufacturing cities, and told they had <i>no</i>
      representative in Parliament; what do you suppose he would think and say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would advise them to get a few paper caps among their coronets,&rdquo; said
      Josepha.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it goes all over England,&rdquo; said the squire. &ldquo;Really, my dears,
      two-thirds of the House of Commons are composed of the nominees of the
      nobles and the great landowners. What comes of the poor man&rsquo;s rights under
      such circumstances? He hes been robbed of them for centuries; doesn&rsquo;t tha
      think, Annie, it is about time he looked after them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was full time,&rdquo; Josepha said hotly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a difficult question,&rdquo; replied Annie. &ldquo;It must have many sides that
      require examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is right needs no examination, Annie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, women, I have but told you one-half of the condition. There is
      another side of it, for if some places hev been growing less and less
      during the past centuries, other places, once hardly known, have become
      great cities, like Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Sheffield, and so forth,
      and have no representation at all. What do you think of that? Not a soul
      in parliament to speak for them. Now if men hev to pay taxes they like to
      know a little bit about their whys and wherefores, eh, women?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they always want to know, father?&rdquo; asked Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so. It would only be natural, Kitty, but at any rate since
      the days of King John; and I don&rsquo;t believe but what the ways of men and
      the wants of men hev been about the same iver since God made men. They hev
      allays wanted a king and they hev allays been varry particular about
      hev-ing some ways and means of making a king do what they want him to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Suppose the lords pass The Bill but alter it so much that it is <i>not
      The Bill</i>, what then, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Kitty, they could do that thing but as your aunt said, they had
      better not. Nothing but the whole Bill will now satisfy. No! they dare not
      alter it. Now you can talk over what I hev told you. I must go about my
      awn business and the first thing I hev to do is to take my wife home.
      Come, Annie, I am needing thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annie rose with a happy alacrity. She was glad to go. To be alone with her
      husband after the past days of society&rsquo;s patented pleasures was an
      unspeakable rest and refreshment. They drove to the Clarendon in silent
      contentment, holding each other&rsquo;s hand and putting off speech until they
      could talk without restraint of any kind. And if anyone learned in the
      expression of the flesh had noticed their hands they would have seen that
      Annie&rsquo;s thumb in the clasp was generally the uppermost, a sure sign that
      she had the strongest will and was made to govern. The corollary of this
      fact is, that if the clasping thumb in both parties is the right thumb,
      then complications are most likely to frequently occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed Annie did not speak until she had thrown aside her bonnet and cloak
      and was comfortably seated in the large soft chair she liked best; then
      she said with an air of perfect satisfaction, &ldquo;O Antony! It was so kind
      and thoughtful of thee to come for me. I was afraid there might be some
      unpleasant to-do before I got away. Josepha was ready for one, longing for
      one, and Jane hed to make that excuse about getting dinner ready, in order
      to avoid it. Jane, you know, supports the whole House of Lords, and she
      goes on about &lsquo;The Constitution of the British Government&rsquo; as if it was an
      inspired document.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well tha knows, Leyland is a Tory from his head to his feet. I doan&rsquo;t
      think his mind hes much to do with his opinions. He inherited them from
      his father, just as he inherited his father&rsquo;s face and size and money. And
      a woman hes to think as her husband thinks&mdash;if she claims to be a
      good wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That idea is an antiquated lie, Antony. A good wife, Antony, thinks not
      only for herself, she thinks also for her husband.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I niver noticed thee making thysen contrary. As I think, thou thinks.
      Allays that is so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, it is not. There is many a thing different in my mind to what is in
      thy mind, and thou knows it, too; and there are subjects we neither of us
      want to talk of because we cannot agree about them. I often thank thee for
      thy kind self-denial in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I doan&rsquo;t know what thou art so precious civil about. I think of
      varry little now but the Reform Bill and the poor weavers; and thou thinks
      with me on both of them subjects. Eh, Joy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do&mdash;with some sub-differences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t meddle with what thou calls thy &lsquo;subdifferences.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll warrant
      they are innocent as thysen and thy son Dick is a good son and he thinks
      just as I think on ivery subject. That&rsquo;s enough, Annie, on
      sub-differences. Let us hev a bit of a comfortable lunch. Jane&rsquo;s breakfast
      was cold and made up of fancy dishes like oysters and chicken minced with
      mushrooms, and muffins and such miscarriages of eatable dishes. I want
      some sensible eating at one o&rsquo;clock and I feel as if it was varry near one
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What shall I order for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some kidney soup and cold roast beef and a good pudding, or some Christ
      Church tartlets, the best vegetables they hev and a bottle of Bass&rsquo; best
      ale or porter, but thou can-hev a cup of sloppy tea if tha fancies it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think no better of sloppy things than thou does, Antony. I&rsquo;ll hev a
      glass of good, pale sherry wine, and the same would be better for thee
      than anything Bass brews. Bass makes a man stout, and thou art now just
      the right weight; an ounce more flesh would spoil thy figure and take the
      spring out of thy step and put more color in thy face and take the music
      out of thy voice; but please thy dear self about thy eating; perhaps I am
      a bit selfish about thy good looks, but when a woman gets used to showing
      herself off with a handsome man she can&rsquo;t bear to give up that bit of
      pride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Annie dear, whativer pleases thee, pleases me. Send for
      number five, and order what thou thinks best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, Antony, thou shalt have thy own wish. It is little enough to give
      thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is full and plenty, if thou puts thy wish with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Annie happily ordered the kidney soup and cold roast and the
      particular tarts he liked and the sherry instead of the beer, and the fare
      pleased both, and they ate it with that smiling cheerfulness which is of
      all thanksgiving the most acceptable to the Bountiful Giver of all good
      things. And as they ate they talked of Katherine&rsquo;s beauty and loving heart
      and of Dick&rsquo;s ready obedience and manly respect for his father, and food
      so seasoned and so cheerfully eaten is the very best banquet that mortals
      can ever hope to taste in this life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Dick, urged both by his father&rsquo;s desire and his own
      wistful longing to see Faith Foster, lost no time in reaching his home
      village. He was shocked by its loneliness and silence. He did not meet or
      see a single man. The women were shut up in their cottages. Their trouble
      had passed all desire for company and all hope of any immediate
      assistance. Talking only enervated them and they all had the same
      miserable tale to tell. It might have been a deserted village but for the
      musical chime of the church clock and the sight of a few little children
      sitting listlessly on the doorsteps of the cottages. Hunger had killed in
      them the instinct of play. &ldquo;It hurts us to play. It makes the pain come,&rdquo;
       said one little lad, as he looked with large suffering eyes into Dick&rsquo;s
      face; but never asked from him either pity or help. Yet his very silence
      was eloquence. No words could have moved to sympathy so strongly as the
      voiceless appeal of his sad suffering eyes, his thin face, and the patient
      helplessness of his hopeless quiet. Dick could not bear it. He gave the
      child some money, and it began to cry softly and to whimper &ldquo;Mammy!
      Mammy!&rdquo; and Dick hurried homeward, rather ashamed of his own emotion, yet
      full of the tenderest pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Britton pottering about the stable and his wife Sarah trying with
      clumsy fingers to fashion a child&rsquo;s frock. &ldquo;Oh, Master Dick!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;Why did tha come back to this unhappy place? I think there is pining and
      famishing in ivery house and sickness hard following it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come, Sarah, to see what can be done to help the trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A God&rsquo;s mercy, sir! We be hard set in Annis village this day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a room ready for me, Sarah? I may be here for a few days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a varry queer thing if I hedn&rsquo;t a room ready for any of the
      family, coming in a hurry like. Your awn room is spick and span, sir. And
      I&rsquo;ll hev a bit of fire there in ten minutes or thereby, but tha surely
      will hev summat to eat first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing to eat just yet, Sarah. I shall want a little dinner about five
      o&rsquo;clock if you will have it ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir. We hev no beef or mutton in t&rsquo; house, sir, but I will
      kill a chicken and make a rice pudding, if that will do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all I want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dick went to the stables and interviewed Britton, and spoke to every
      horse in it, and asked Britton to turn them into the paddock for a couple
      of hours. &ldquo;They are needing fresh air and a little liberty, Britton,&rdquo; he
      said, and as Britton loosened their halters and opened the door that led
      into the paddock they went out prancing and neighing their gratitude for
      the favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That little gray mare, sir,&rdquo; said Britton, &ldquo;she hes as much sense as a
      human. She knew first of all of them what was coming, and she knew it was
      your doing, sir, that&rsquo;s the reason she nudged up against you and fairly
      laid her face against yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she knew me, Britton. Lucy and I have had many a happy day
      together.&rdquo; Then he asked Britton about the cattle and the poultry, and
      especially about the bulbs and the garden flowers, which had always had
      more or less the care of Mistress Annis.
    </p>
    <p>
      These things attended to, he went to his room and dressed himself with
      what seemed to be some unnecessary care. Dick, however, did not think so.
      He was going to see Mr. Foster and he might see Faith, and he could not
      think of himself as wearing clothing travel-soiled in her presence. In an
      hour, however, he was ready to go to the village, fittingly dressed from
      head to feet, handsome as handsome Youth can be, and the gleam and glow of
      a true love in his heart. &ldquo;It may be&mdash;it may be!&rdquo; he told himself as
      he walked speedily down the nearest way to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      When about half-way there, he met the preacher. &ldquo;I heard you were here,
      Mr. Annis,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Betty Bews told me she saw you pass her cottage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came in answer to your letter, sir. The Bill is at a great crisis, and
      my father&rsquo;s vote on the right side is needed. And I was glad to come, if I
      can do good in any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, sir, there are things to do, and words to say that I cannot do
      or say&mdash;and the need is urgent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let us go forward. I was shocked by the village as I passed through
      it. I did not meet a single man. I saw only a few sickly looking women,
      and some piteous children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The men have gone somewhere four days ago. I suppose they were called by
      their society. They did not tell me where they were going and I thought it
      was better not to ask any questions. The women are all sick and
      despairing, the children suffer all they can bear and live. That is one
      phase of the trouble; but there is another coming that I thought you would
      like to be made acquainted with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the cholera, I hope? It has reached London, you know, and the doctors
      are paralyzed by their ignorance of its nature and can find no remedy for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our people think it a judgment of God. I am told it broke out in Bristol
      while the city was burning and outrages of all kinds rampant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, sir, that Bristol is one of our largest seaports. It is more
      likely to have been brought here by some traveler from a strange country.
      I heard a medical man who has been in India with our troops say that it
      was a common sickness in the West Indies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was never seen nor heard of in England before. Now it is going up the
      east coast of Britain as far north as the Shetland Isles. These coast
      people are nearly all fishermen, very good, pious men, and they positively
      declare that they saw a gigantic figure of a woman, shadowy and gray, with
      a face of malignant vengeance, passing through the land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has sent such messengers many times&mdash;ministers of His Vengeance.
      His Word is full of such instances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But a woman with a malignant face! Oh, no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is evil, must look evil&mdash;but here we are at Jonathan
      Hartley&rsquo;s. Will you go in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is coming to us. I will give him my father&rsquo;s letter. That will be
      sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Jonathan had much to say and he seemed troubled beyond outside affairs
      to move him, and the preacher asked&mdash;&ldquo;What is personally out of the
      right way with you, Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, my mother is down at the ford; she may cross any hour&mdash;she&rsquo;s
      only waiting for the guide&mdash;and my eldest girl had a son last night&mdash;the
      little lad was born half-starved. We doan&rsquo;t know yet whether either of
      them can be saved&mdash;or not. So I&rsquo;ll not say &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; but if you&rsquo;ll
      sit down with me on the garden bench, I&rsquo;ll be glad of a few minutes fresh
      air.&rdquo; He opened the little wicket gate as he spoke and they sat down on a
      bench under a cherry tree full dressed in perfumed white for Easter tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were seated the young squire delivered his father&rsquo;s letter
      and then they talked of the sudden disappearance of the men of the
      village. &ldquo;What does it mean, Jonathan?&rdquo; asked Dick, and Jonathan said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I hevn&rsquo;t been much among the lads for a week now. My mother
      hes been lying at the gate of the grave and I couldn&rsquo;t leave her long at a
      time. They were all loitering about the village when I saw them last.
      Suddenly they all disappeared, and the old woman at the post office told
      me ivery one of them hed received a letter four mornings ago, from the
      same Working Man&rsquo;s Society. I hed one mysen, for that matter, and that
      afternoon they all left together for somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Dick, &ldquo;where did they get the money necessary for a journey?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Philip Sugden got the money from Sugbury Bank. He hed an order for it,
      that was cashed quick enough. What do you make of that, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there may be fighting to do if parliament fails the people this
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in the very crisis of this trouble,&rdquo; said Dick, &ldquo;I hear from Mr.
      Foster that a man has been here wanting to build a mill. Who is he,
      Jonathan? And what can be his motive?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His name is Jonas Boocock. He comes from Shipley. His motive is to mak&rsquo; 
      money. He thinks this is the varry place to do it. He talked constantly
      about its fine water power, and its cheap land, and thought Providence hed
      fairly laid it out for factories and power-looms; for he said there&rsquo;s talk
      of a branch of railway from Bradley&rsquo;s place, past Annis, to join the main
      track going to Leeds. He considered it a varry grand idea. Mebbe it is,
      sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father would not like the plan at all. It must be prevented, if
      possible. What do you think, Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir, if it would be a grand thing for Jonas Boocock, it might
      happen be a good thing for Squire Antony Annis. The world is moving
      for-rard, sir, and we must step with it, or be dragged behind it. Old as I
      am, I would rayther step for-rard with it. Gentlemen, I must now go to my
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she worse, Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is quite worn out, worn out to the varry marrow. I would be thankful,
      sir, if tha would call and bid her good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will. I will come about seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will be right. I&rsquo;ll hev all the household present, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then they turned away from Jonathan&rsquo;s house and went to look at the land
      Boocock hankered for. The land itself was a spur descending from the wold,
      and was heathery and not fit for cultivation; but it was splendidly
      watered and lay along the river bank. &ldquo;Boocock was right,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Foster. &ldquo;It is a bit of land just about perfect for a factory site. Does
      the squire own it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot say. I was trying to fix its position as well as I could, and I
      will write to my father tonight. I am sorry Jonathan did not know more
      about the man Boocock and his plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonathan&rsquo;s mother is a very old woman. While she lives, he will stay at
      her side. You must remember her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do. She was exceedingly tall and walked quite erect and was so white
      when I met her last that she looked like a ghost floating slowly along the
      road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She had always a sense of being injured by being here at all&mdash;wondered
      why she had been sent to this world, and though a grand character was
      never really happy. Jonathan did not learn to read until he was over forty
      years of age; she was then eighty, and she helped him to remember his
      letters, and took the greatest pride in his progress. There ought to be
      schools for these people, there are splendid men and women mentally among
      them. Here we are at home. Come in, sir, and have a cup of tea with us
      before you climb the brow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick was very glad to accept the invitation and the preacher opened the
      door and said: &ldquo;Come in, sir, and welcome!&rdquo; and they went into a small
      parlor plainly furnished, but in perfect order, and Dick heard someone
      singing softly not far away. Before the preacher had more than given his
      guest a chair the door opened and Faith entered the room. If he had not
      been already in love with her he would have fallen fathoms deep in the
      divine tide that moment, for his soul knew her and loved her, and was
      longing to claim its own. What personal charm she had he knew not, he
      cared not, he had been drawn to her by some deep irresistible attraction,
      and he succumbed absolutely to its influence. At this moment he cast away
      all fears and doubts and gave himself without reservation to the wonderful
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith had answered her father&rsquo;s call so rapidly, that Dick was not seated
      when she entered the room. She brought with her into the room an
      atmosphere of light and peace, through which her loveliness shone with a
      soft, steady glow. There was something unknown and unseen in her very
      simplicity. All that was sweet and wise, shone in her heavenly eyes, and
      their light lifted her higher than all his thoughts; they were so soft and
      deep and compelling. Very singularly their influence seemed to be
      intensified by the simple dress she wore. It was of merino and of the
      exact shade of her eyes, and it appeared in some way to increase their
      mystical power by the prolongation of the same color. There was nothing of
      intention in this arrangement. It was one of those coincidences that are
      perhaps suggested or induced by the angel that guards our life and
      destiny. For there are angels round all of us. Earth is no strange land to
      them. The dainty neatness of her clothing delighted Dick. After a season
      of ruffles and flounces and extravagant trimming, its soft folds falling
      plainly and unbrokenly to her feet, charmed him. Something of white lace,
      very narrow and unpretentious, was around the neck and sleeves which were
      gathered into a band above the elbows. Her hair, parted in the center of
      the forehead, lay in soft curls which fell no lower than the tip of the
      ears and at the back was coiled loosely on the crown of the head, where it
      was fastened by a pretty shell comb. The purity and peace of a fervent
      transparent soul was the first and the last impression she made, and these
      qualities revealed themselves in a certain homely sweetness, that drew
      everyone&rsquo;s affection and trust like a charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had in her hands a clean tablecloth and some napkins, but when she saw
      Dick, she laid them down, and went to meet him. He took her hand and
      looked into her eyes, and a rush of color came into her face and gave
      splendor to her smile and her beauty. She hastened to question him about
      his mother and Katherine, but even as they talked of others, she knew he
      was telling her that he loved her, and longed for her to love him in
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith, my dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Foster, &ldquo;our friend, Mr. Annis, will have a cup
      of tea with us before he goes up the brow,&rdquo; and she looked at Dick and
      smiled, and began to lay the round table that stood in the center of the
      room. Dick watched her beautiful white arms and hands among the white
      china and linen and a very handsome silver tea service, with a pleasure
      that made him almost faint. Oh, if he should lose this lovely girl! How
      could he bear it? He felt that he might as well lose life itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For though Dick had loved her for some months, love not converted into
      action, becomes indolent and unbelieving. So he had misgivings he could
      not control and amid the distractions of London, his love, instead of
      giving a new meaning to his life, had infected him rather with a sense of
      dreamland. But in this hour, true honest love illumined life, he saw
      things as they were, he really fell in love and that is a wonderful
      experience, a deep, elemental thing, beyond all reasoning with. In this
      experience he had found at last the Key to Life, and he understood in a
      moment, as it were, that this Key is in the Heart, and not in the Brain.
      He had been very wise and prudent about Faith and one smile from her had
      shattered all his reasoning, and the love-light now in his eyes, and
      shining in his face, was heart-work and not brain work. For love is a
      state of the soul; anger, grief and other passions can change their mental
      states; but love? No! Love absorbs the whole man, and if not satisfied,
      causes a state of great suffering. So in that hour Love was Destiny and
      fashioned his life beyond the power of any other passion to change.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Faith brought in tea and some fresh bread and butter, and
      a dish of broiled trout. &ldquo;Mr. Braithwaite was trout fishing among the
      fells to-day,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and as he came home, he left half a dozen for
      father. He is one of the Chapel Trustees and very fond of line fishing.
      Sometimes father goes with him. You know,&rdquo; she added with a smile,
      &ldquo;fishing is apostolical. Even a Methodist preacher may fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a short time they talked of the reel and line, and its caprices, but
      conversation quickly drifted to the condition of the country and of Annis
      particularly, and in this conversation an hour drifted speedily away. Then
      Faith rose and brought in a bowl of hot water, washed the china and silver
      and put them away in a little corner cupboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That silver is very beautiful,&rdquo; said Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it in your hand, Mr. Annis, and read what is engraved on the tea
      pot.&rdquo; So Dick took it in his hand and read that the whole service had been
      given by the Wesleyans of Thirsk to Reverend Mr. Foster, as a proof of
      their gratitude to him as their spiritual teacher and comforter. Then Dick
      noticed the china and said his mother had a set exactly like it and Mr.
      Foster answered&mdash;&ldquo;I think, Mr. Annis, every family in England has
      one, rich and poor. Whoever hit upon this plain white china, with its
      broad gold band round all edges, hit on something that fitted the English
      taste universally. It will be a wedding gift, and a standard tea set, for
      many generations yet; unless it deteriorates in style and quality&mdash;but
      I must not forget that I am due at Hartley&rsquo;s at seven o&rsquo;clock, so I hope
      you will excuse me, Mr. Annis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask your permission to remain with Miss Foster until your return,
      sir? I have a great deal to tell her about Katherine and many messages
      from my sister to deliver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mr. Foster hesitated, then he answered frankly, &ldquo;I will be
      glad if you stay with Faith until I return.&rdquo; Then Faith helped him on with
      his top coat and gave him his hat and gloves and walking stick and both
      Dick and Faith stood at the open door, and watched him go down the street
      a little way. But this was Dick&rsquo;s opportunity and he would not lose it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come into the parlor, dear, dear Faith! I have something to tell you,
      something I must tell you!&rdquo; And all he said in the parlor was something he
      had never dared to say before, except in dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      Faith knew what he wished to say. He had wooed her silently for months,
      but she had not suffered him to pass beyond the horizon of her thoughts.
      Yet she knew well, that though they were in many things dissimilar as two
      notes of music, they were made for each other. She told herself that he
      knew this fact as well as she did and that at the appointed hour he would
      come to her. Until that hour she would not provoke Destiny by her
      impatience. A change so great for her would doubtless involve other
      changes and perhaps their incidentals were not yet ready. So she never
      doubted but that Dick would tell her he loved her, as soon as he thought
      the right hour had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the hour had come, and Dick did tell her how he loved her with a
      passionate eloquence that astonished himself. She did not try to resist
      its influence. It was to her heart all that cold water would be to
      parching thirst; it was the coming together of two strong, but different
      temperaments, and from the contact the flashing forth of love like fire.
      His words went to her head like wine, her eyes grew soft, tender,
      luminous, her form was half mystical, half sensuous. Dick was creating a
      new world for them, all their own. Though her eyes lifted but an instant,
      her soul sought his soul, gradually they leaned closer to each other in
      visible sweetness and affection and then it was no effort, but a supreme
      joy, to ask her to be his wife, to love and counsel and guide him, as his
      mother had loved and guided his father; and in the sweet, trembling patois
      of love, she gave him the promise that taught him what real happiness
      means. And her warm, sweet kisses sealed it. He felt they did so and was
      rapturously happy. Is there anything more to be said on this subject? No,
      the words are not yet invented which could continue it. Yet Faith wrote in
      her Diary that night&mdash;&ldquo;To-day I was born into the world of Love. That
      is the world God loves best.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;No mortal thing can bear so high a price,

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> MAN in love sees
      miracles, as well as expects them. Outsiders are apt to think him an
      absurd creature, he himself knows that he is seeking the only love that
      can complete and crown his life. Dick was quite sure of his own wisdom.
      Whenever he thought of Faith, of her innocence, her high hopes, her pure
      eyes, and flowerlike beauty, he felt that his feet were on a rock and his
      soul went after her and everything was changed in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until great London was on his horizon, that any fear touched
      his naturally high spirit. His father&rsquo;s good will, he was sure, could be
      relied on. He himself had made what his father called &ldquo;a varry
      inconsiderate marriage,&rdquo; but it had proved to be both a very wise and a
      very happy union, so Dick expected his father would understand and
      sympathize with his love for Faith Foster.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the women of his family he felt more uncertain, his mother and
      sister and aunt would doubtless be harder to please. Yet they must see
      that Faith was everyway exceptional. Was she not the very flower and pearl
      of womanhood? He could not understand how they could find any fault with
      his wonderfully fortunate choice. Yet he kindly considered the small
      frailties of the ordinary woman and made some allowances for their
      jealousies and for the other interferences likely to spring from family
      and social conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dick was no coward and he was determined to speak of his engagement to
      Faith as soon as he had rid his mind of the business which had sent him to
      Annis. Nor had he any love-lorn looks or attitudes; he appeared to be an
      exceedingly happy man, when he opened the parlor door of his father&rsquo;s
      apartments in the Clarendon. Breakfast was on the table and the squire and
      his wife were calmly enjoying it. They cried out joyfully when they saw
      him. The squire hastily stood up with outstretched hands, while Dick&rsquo;s
      mother cried out, &ldquo;O Dick! Dick! how good it is to see thee!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick was soon seated between them and as he ate he told the news he had
      brought from the home village. It was all interesting and important to
      them&mdash;from the change in its politics&mdash;which Dick said had
      become nearly Radical&mdash;to the death of Jonathan Hartley&rsquo;s mother, who
      had been for many years a great favorite of Mistress Annis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was a little astonished to find that his father pooh-pooh&rsquo;d Boocock&rsquo;s
      design of building a mill in Annis. &ldquo;He can&rsquo;t build ef he can&rsquo;t get land
      and water,&rdquo; he answered with a scornful laugh; &ldquo;and Antony Annis will not
      let him hev either. He is just another of those once decent weavers, who
      hev been turned into arrant fools by making brass too easy and too quick.
      I hev heard them talk. They are allays going to build another mill
      somewhere, they are going to mak&rsquo; a bid for all Yorkshire and mebbe tak&rsquo; 
      Lancashire into their plans. Boocock does not trouble me. And if Squire
      Annis puts him in Cold Shoulder Lane, there will not be a man in t&rsquo; 
      neighborhood poor and mean enough to even touch his cap to him. This is
      all I hev to say about Boocock at the present time and I don&rsquo;t want him
      mentioned again. Mind that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, then, father, that you will have to get rid of Jonathan
      Hartley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rid of Jonathan! Whativer is tha talking about? I could spare him as
      little as my right hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jonathan told me to tell you that you had better build a mill yourself,
      than let Boocock, or some other stranger, in among Annis folk. He said the
      world was stepping onward and that we had better step with the world, than
      be dragged behind it. He said that was his feeling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he hes a right to his feeling, but he need not send it to me. Let
      him go. I see how it is. I am getting a bit older than I was and men that
      are younger five or ten years are deserting me. They fear to be seen with
      an old fogy, like Squire Annis. God help me, but&mdash;I&rsquo;m not downed yet.
      If they can do without me, I can jolly well do without them. <i>Why-a!</i>
      Thy mother is worth iverybody else to me and she&rsquo;ll love and cherish me if
      I add fifty years more to my present fifty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want no other love, Antony, than yours. It is good enough for life&mdash;and
      thereafter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear Annie! And don&rsquo;t fear! When I am sure it is time to move, I&rsquo;ll
      move. I&rsquo;ll outstrip them all yet. By George, I&rsquo;ll keep them panting after
      me! How is it, Dick? Wilt thou stand with thy father? If so, put thy hand
      in thy father&rsquo;s and we will beat them all at their awn game&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Dick put his hand in his father&rsquo;s hand and answered, &ldquo;I am your loving and
      obedient son. Your will is my pleasure, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, dear lad! Then we two will do as we want to do, we&rsquo;ll do it in our
      awn time, and in our awn way, and we hev sense enough, between us, to tak&rsquo; 
      our awn advice, whativer it be. For first of all, we&rsquo;ll do whativer is
      best for the village, and then for oursens, without anybody&rsquo;s advice but
      our awn. Just as soon as The Bill is off my mind we will hev a talk on
      this subject. Annis Hall and Annis land and water is our property&mdash;mine
      and thine&mdash;and we will do whativer is right, both to the land and
      oursens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Dick&rsquo;s loving face, and the little sympathizing nod of his head, was
      all the squire needed. Then he stood up, lifting himself to his full
      height, and added, &ldquo;Boocock and his mill will have to wait on my say-so,
      and I haven&rsquo;t room in my mind at present to consider him; so we will say
      no more on that subject, until he comes and asks me for the land and water
      he wants. What is tha going to do with thysen now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That depends upon your wish, father. Are you going to&mdash;The House?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The House! Hes tha forgotten that the English Government must hev its
      usual Easter recreation whativer comes or goes? I told thee&mdash;I told
      thee in my first letter to Annis, that parliament hed given themsens three
      weeks&rsquo; holiday. They feel a good bit tired. The Bill hed them all worn
      out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember! I had forgotten The Bill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whativer hes tha been thinking of to forget that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where then are you going to-day, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t just know yet, Dick, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I know where I am going,&rdquo; said Mistress Annis. &ldquo;I have an
      engagement with Jane and Katherine at eleven and I shall have to hurry if
      I am to keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somewhere to go, or something to do. Which is it, Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is both, Antony. We are going to Exeter Hall, to a very aristocratic
      meeting, to make plans for the uplifting of the working man. Lord Brougham
      is to be chairman. He says very few can read and hardly any write their
      names. Shocking! Lord Brougham says we ought to be ashamed of such a
      condition and do something immediately to alter it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brougham does not know what he is talking about. He thinks a man&rsquo;s
      salvation is in a spelling book and an inkhorn. There is going to be a
      deal of trouble made by fools, who want to uplift the world, before the
      world is ready to be uplifted. They can&rsquo;t uplift starving men. It is
      bread, not books, they want; and I hev allays seen that when a man gets
      bare enough bread to keep body and soul together, the soul, or the mind,
      gets the worst of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot help that,&rdquo; said Mistress Annis. &ldquo;Lord Brougham will prove to
      us, that body and mind must be equally cared for or the man is not
      developed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, run away to thy developing work. It is a new kind of job for
      thee; and I doan&rsquo;t think it will suit thee&mdash;not a bit of it. I would
      go with thee but developing working men is a step or two out of my way.
      And I&rsquo;ll tell thee something, the working men&mdash;and women, too&mdash;will
      develop theirsens if we only give them the time and the means, and the
      brass to do it. But go thy ways and if thou art any wiser after Brougham&rsquo;s
      talk I&rsquo;ll be glad to know what he said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall stay and dine with Jane and thou hed better join us. We may go to
      the opera afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, I&rsquo;ll not join thee. I wouldn&rsquo;t go to another opera for
      anything&mdash;not even for the great pleasure of thy company. If I hev to
      listen to folk singing, I want them to sing in the English language. It is
      good enough, and far too good, for any of the rubbishy words I iver heard
      in any opera. What time shall I come to Jane&rsquo;s for thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About eleven o&rsquo;clock, or soon after.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a nice time for a respectable squire&rsquo;s wife to be driving about
      London streets. I wish I hed thee safe at Annis Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a laugh Annie closed the door and hurried away and Dick turned to his
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk with you, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;on a subject which I want your
      help and sympathy in, before I name it to anyone else. Suppose we sit
      still here. The room is quiet and comfortable and we are not likely to be
      disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why then, Dick! Hes tha got a new sweetheart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and she is the dearest and loneliest woman that ever lived. I
      want you to stand by me in any opposition likely to rise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is her name? Who is she?&rdquo; asked the squire not very cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her name is Faith Foster. You know her, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know her. She is a good beautiful girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt sure you would say that, sir. You make me very happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man cannot lie about any woman. Faith Foster is good and beautiful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she has promised to be my wife. Father, I am so happy! So happy! And
      your satisfaction with Faith doubles my pleasure. I have been in love with
      her for nearly a year but I was afraid to lose all by asking all; and I
      never found courage or opportunity to speak before this to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is all buff and bounce. Thou can drop the word &lsquo;courage,&rsquo; and
      opportunity will do for a reason. I niver knew Dick Annis to be afraid of
      a girl but if thou art really afraid of this girl&mdash;let her go. It is
      the life of a dog to live with a woman that you fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, you have seen Faith often. Do you fear her in the way your words
      seem to imply?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me! Does tha think I fear any woman? What&rsquo;s up with thee to ask such a
      question as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought from your kind manner with Faith and your admiring words both
      to her and about her that you would have congratulated me on my success in
      winning her love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t know as thou deserves much congratulation on that score. I think
      it is mebbe, to me mysen, and to thy mother thou art mainly indebted for
      what success there is in winning Miss Foster&rsquo;s favor. We gave thee thy
      handsome face and fine form, thy bright smile and that coaxing way thou
      hes&mdash;a way that would win any lass thou choose to favor&mdash;it is
      just the awful way young men hev, of choosing the wrong time to marry even
      if they happen to choose the right woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that your way, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, was it! I chose the right time, but the girl was wrong enough in some
      ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother wrong! Oh, no, father!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father thought she was not rich enough for me. He was a good bit
      disappointed by my choice but I knew what I was doing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, I also know what I am doing. I suppose you object to Faith&rsquo;s want
      of fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mebbe I do, and I wouldn&rsquo;t be to blame if I did, but as it happens I
      think a man is better without his wife&rsquo;s money. A wife&rsquo;s money is a
      quarrelsome bit of either land or gold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I consider Faith&rsquo;s goodness a fortune far beyond any amount of either
      gold or land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doan&rsquo;t thee say anything against either land or gold. When thou hes lived
      as long as I hev thou wilt know better than do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wisdom is better than riches. I have heard you say that often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in Solomon&rsquo;s time. I doan&rsquo;t know that it is in Victoria&rsquo;s. The
      wise men of this day would be a deal wiser if they hed a bit of gold to
      carry out all the machines and railroads and canals they are planning; and
      what would the final outcome be, if they hed it? Money, money, and still
      more money. This last year, Dick, I hev got some new light both on poverty
      and riches and I have seen one thing plainly, it is that money is a varry
      good, respectable thing, and a thing that goes well with lovemaking; but
      poverty is the least romantic of all misfortunes. A man may hide, or cure,
      or forget any other kind of trouble, but, my lad, there is no Sanctuary
      for Poverty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you say is right, father, but if Faith&rsquo;s want of fortune is no great
      objection, is there any other reason why I should not marry her? We might
      as well speak plainly now, as afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is my way. I hate any backstair work, especially about marrying.
      Well, then, one thing is that Faith&rsquo;s people are all Chapel folk. The
      Squire of Annis is a landed gentleman of England, and the men who own
      England&rsquo;s land hev an obligation to worship in England&rsquo;s Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, father, that wives have a duty laid on them to make their
      husbands&rsquo; church their church. Faith will worship where I worship and that
      is in Annis Parish Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does tha know of Faith&rsquo;s father and mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her grandfather was a joiner and carpenter and a first class workman. He
      died of a fever just before the birth of Faith&rsquo;s mother. Her grandmother
      was a fine lace maker, and supported herself and her child by making lace
      for eight years. Then she died and the girl, having no kindred and no
      friends willing to care for her, was taken to the Poor House.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dick! Dick! that is bad&mdash;very bad indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen, father. At the Poor House Sunday school she learned to read, and
      later was taught how to spin, and weave, and to sew and knit. She was a
      silent child, but had fine health and a wonderfully ambitious nature. At
      eleven years of age she took her living into her own hands. She went into
      a woolen mill and made enough to pay her way in the family of Samuel
      Broadbent, whose sons now own the great Broadbent mill with its six
      hundred power-looms. When she was fifteen she could manage two looms, and
      was earning more than a pound a week. Every shilling nearly of this money
      went for books. She bought, she borrowed, she read every volume she could
      reach; and in the meantime attended the Bradford Night School of the
      Methodist Church. At seventeen years of age she was a very good scholar
      and had such a remarkable knowledge of current literature and authors that
      she was made the second clerk in the Public Library. Soon after, she
      joined the Methodist Church, and her abilities were quickly recognized by
      the Preacher, and she finally went to live with his family, teaching his
      boys and girls, and being taught and protected by their mother. One day
      Mr. Foster came as the second preacher in that circuit and he fell in love
      with her and they married. Faith is their child, and she has inherited not
      only her mother&rsquo;s beauty and intellect, but her father&rsquo;s fervent piety and
      humanity. Since her mother&rsquo;s death she has been her father&rsquo;s companion and
      helped in all his good works, as you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know&mdash;hes her mother been long dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About six years. She left to the young girls who have to work for their
      living several valuable text-books to assist them in educating themselves,
      a very highly prized volume of religious experiences and a still more
      popular book of exquisite poems. Is there anything in this record to be
      called objectionable or not honorable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Ask thy mother</i> that question, Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, father, I want your help and sympathy. I expect nothing favorable
      from mother. You must stand by me in this strait. If you accept Faith my
      mother will accept her. Show her the way. Do, father! Always you have been
      right-hearted with me. You have been through this hard trial yourself,
      father. You know what it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do; and I managed it in a way that thou must not think of,
      or I will niver forgive thee. I knew my father and mother would neither be
      to coax nor to reason with, and just got quietly wedded and went off to
      France with my bride. I didn&rsquo;t want any browbeating from my father and I
      niver could hev borne my mother&rsquo;s scorn and silence, so I thought it best
      to come to some sort of terms with a few hundred miles between us&mdash;but
      mind what I say, Dick! I was niver again happy with them. They felt that I
      hed not trusted their love and they niver more trusted my love. There was
      a gulf between us that no love could bridge. Father died with a hurt
      feeling in his heart. Mother left my house and went back to her awn home
      as soon as he was buried. All that thy mother could do niver won her more
      than mere tolerance. Now, Dick, my dear lad, I hev raked up this old grief
      of mine for thy sake. If tha can win thy mother&rsquo;s promise to accept Faith
      as a daughter, and the future mistress of Annis Hall, I&rsquo;ll put no stone in
      thy way. Hes tha said anything on this subject to Mr. Foster? If so, what
      answer did he give thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said the marriage would be a great pleasure to him if you and mother
      were equally pleased; but not otherwise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was right, it was just what I expected from him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, father, until our engagement was fully recognized by you and mother,
      he forbid us to meet, or even to write to each other. I can&rsquo;t bear that. I
      really can not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I doan&rsquo;t believe Faith will help thee to break such a command. Not
      her! She will keep ivery letter of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I shall die. I could not endure such cruelty! I will&mdash;I will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whativer thou shall, could, or will, do try and not make a fool of
      thysen. <i>Drat it, man!</i> Let me see thee in this thy first trial <i>right-side-out</i>.
      Furthermore, I&rsquo;ll not hev thee going about Annis village with that look on
      thy face as if ivery thing was on the perish. There isn&rsquo;t a man there, who
      wouldn&rsquo;t know the meaning of it and they would wink at one another and say
      &lsquo;poor beggar! it&rsquo;s the Methody preacher&rsquo;s little lass!&rsquo; There it is! and
      thou knows it, as well as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let them mock if they want to. I&rsquo;ll thrash every man that names her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be quiet! I&rsquo;ll hev none of thy tempers, so just bid thy Yorkshire devil
      to get behind thee. I hev made thee a promise and I&rsquo;ll keep it, if tha
      does thy part fairly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is my part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is to win over thy mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You, sir, have far more influence over mother than I have. If I cannot
      win mother, will you try, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I will not. Now, Dick, doan&rsquo;t let me see thee wilt in thy first
      fight. Pluck up courage and win or fail with a high heart. And if tha
      should fail, just take the knockdown with a smile, and say,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;If she is not fair for me,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      What care I how fair she be!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      That was the young men&rsquo;s song in my youth. Now we will drop the subject
      and what dost tha say to a ride in the Park?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The ride was not much to speak of. One man was too happy, and the other
      was too unhappy and eventually the squire put a stop to it. &ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; he
      said, &ldquo;tha hed better go to thy room at The Yorkshire Club and sleep
      thysen into a more respectable temper.&rdquo; And Dick answered, &ldquo;Thank you,
      sir. I will take your advice&rdquo;&mdash;and so raising his hand to his hat he
      rapidly disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor lad!&rdquo; muttered his father; &ldquo;he hes some hard days before him but it
      would niver do to give him what he wants and there is no ither way to put
      things right&rdquo;&mdash;and with this reflection the squire&rsquo;s good spirits
      fell even below his son&rsquo;s melancholy. Then he resolved to go back to the
      Clarendon. &ldquo;Annie may come back there to dress before her dinner and
      opera,&rdquo; he reflected&mdash;&ldquo;but if she does I&rsquo;ll not tell her a word of
      Dick&rsquo;s trouble. No, indeed! Dick must carry his awn bad news. I hev often
      told her unpleasant things and usually I got the brunt o&rsquo; them mysen. So
      if Annie comes home to dress&mdash;and she does do so varry often lately&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      not mention Dick&rsquo;s affair to her. I hev noticed that she dresses hersen
      varry smart now and, by George, it suits her well! In her way she looks as
      handsome as either of her daughters. I did not quite refuse to dine at
      Jane&rsquo;s, I think she will come to the Clarendon to dress and to beg me to
      go with her and I might as well go&mdash;here she comes! I know her step,
      bless her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dick left his father he went to his sister&rsquo;s residence. He knew that
      Jane and his mother were at the lecture but he did not think that
      Katherine would be with them and he felt sure of Katherine&rsquo;s sympathy. He
      was told that she had just gone to Madam Temple&rsquo;s and he at once followed
      her there and found her writing a letter and quite alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty! Kitty!&rdquo; he cried in a lachrymose tone. &ldquo;I am in great trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever is wrong, Dick? Are you wanting money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not thinking or caring anything about money. I want Faith and her
      father will not let me see her or write to her unless father and mother
      are ready to welcome her as a daughter. They ought to do so and father is
      not very unwilling; but I know mother will make a stir about it and father
      will not move in the matter for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Move?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want him to go to mother and make her do the kind and the right
      thing and he will not do it for me, though he knows that mother always
      gives in to what he thinks best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She keeps her own side, Dick, and goes as far as she can, but it is
      seldom she gets far enough without father&rsquo;s consent. Father always keeps
      the decisive word for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what I say. Then father could&mdash;if he would&mdash;say the
      decisive word and so make mother agree to my marriage with Faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well you see, Dick, mother is father&rsquo;s love affair and why should he have
      a dispute with his wife to make you and your intended wife comfortable and
      happy? Mother has always been in favor of Harry Bradley and she does not
      prevent us seeing or writing each other, when it is possible, but she will
      not hear of our engagement being made public, because it would hurt
      father&rsquo;s feelings and she is half-right anyway. A wife ought to regard her
      husband&rsquo;s feelings. You would expect that, if you were married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Kitty, I am so miserable. Will you sound mother&rsquo;s feelings about
      Faith for me? Then I would have a better idea how to approach her on the
      subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, if possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, dearie! I love Faith so truly that I have forgotten all the
      other women I ever knew. Their very names tire me now. I wonder at myself
      for ever thinking them at all pretty. I could hardly be civil to any of
      them if we met. I shall never care for any woman again, if I miss Faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Dick, that you must marry someone. The family must be kept up.
      Is the trouble Faith&rsquo;s lack of money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is her father and mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her father is a scholar and fine preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but her mother was a working girl, really a mill hand,&rdquo; and then
      Dick told the story of Faith&rsquo;s mother with enthusiasm. Kitty listened with
      interest, but answered, &ldquo;I do not see what you are going to do, Dick. Not
      only mother, but Jane will storm at the degradation you intend to inflict
      upon the house of Annis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are two things I can do. I will marry Faith, and be happier than
      words can tell; or I will leave England forever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, you never can do that. Everything good forbids it&mdash;and there.
      Jane&rsquo;s carriage is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then good-by. When can I see you tomorrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the afternoon, perhaps. I may speak to mother before three o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dick went away and a servant entered with a letter. It was from Lady
      Jane, bidding Katherine return home immediately or she would not be
      dressed in time for dinner. On her way home she passed Dick walking slowly
      with his head cast down and carrying himself in a very dejected manner.
      Katherine stopped the carriage and offered to give him a lift as far as
      his club.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you, Kitty,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;You may interview mother for me if
      you like. I was coming to a resolution to take the bull by the horns, or
      at least in some manner find a way that is satisfactory in the meantime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. There is nothing like patient watching and waiting. Every
      ball finally comes to the hand held out for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then with a nod and a half-smile, Dick lifted his hat and went forward.
      While he was in the act of speaking to Katherine an illuminating thought
      had flashed through his consciousness and he walked with a purposeful
      stride towards his club. Immediately he sat down and began to write a
      letter, and the rapid scratching of the goose quill on the fine glazed
      paper indicated there was no lack of feeling in what he was writing. The
      firm, strong, small letters, the wide open long letters, the rapid fluency
      and haste of the tell-tale quill, all indicated great emotion, and it was
      without hesitation or consideration he boldly signed his name to the
      following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Rev. John Foster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dear Sir:
    </p>
    <p>
      You have made me the most wretched of men. You have made Faith the most
      unhappy of women. Faith never wronged you in all her life. Do you imagine
      she would do for me what she has never before done? I never wronged you by
      one thought. Can you not trust my word and my honor? I throw myself and
      Faith on your mercy. You are punishing us before we have done anything
      worthy of punishment. Is that procedure just and right? If so, it is very
      unlike you. Let me write to Faith once every week and permit her to answer
      my letter. I have given you my word; my word is my honor. I cannot break
      it without your permission, and until you grant my prayer, I am bound by a
      cruel obligation to lead a life, that being beyond Love and Hope, is a
      living death. And the terrible aching torture of this ordeal is that Faith
      must suffer it with me. Sir, I pray your mercy for both of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your sincere suppliant,
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Haveling Annis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick posted this letter as soon as it was written and the following day it
      was in the hands of the preacher. He received it as he was going home to
      his tea, about half past five, and he read it, and then turned towards the
      open country, and read it again and again. He had been in the house of
      mourning all day. His heart was tender, his thoughts sadly tuned to the
      sorrows and broken affections of life, and at the top of the Brow he sat
      down on a large granite boulder and let his heart lead him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard Annis is right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have acted as if I could not trust.
      Oh, how could I so wrong my good, sweet daughter I I have almost insulted
      her, to her lover. Why did I do this evil thing? Self! Self! Only for
      Self! I was determined to serve myself first. I did not consider others as
      I ought to have done&mdash;and Pride! Yes, Pride! John Foster! You have
      been far out of the way of the Master whom you serve. Go quickly, and put
      the wrong right.&rdquo; And he rose at the spiritual order and walked quickly
      home. As he passed through the Green he saw Faith come to the door and
      look up and down the street. &ldquo;She is uneasy about my delay,&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;how careful and loving she is about me! How anxious, if I am a little
      late! The dear one! How I wronged her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been detained, Faith,&rdquo; he said, as she met him at the door. &ldquo;There
      are four deaths from cholera this afternoon, and they talk of forbidding
      me to visit the sick, till this strange sickness disappears.&rdquo; During the
      meal, Foster said nothing of the letter he had received, but as Faith
      rose, he also rose, and laying his hand upon her shoulder said: &ldquo;Faith,
      here is a letter that I received this afternoon from Richard Annis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, I am so sorry! I thought Richard would keep his word. He
      promised me&mdash;&rdquo; and her voice sunk almost to a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Richard has not broken a letter of his promise. The letter was sent to
      me. It is my letter. I want you to read it, and to answer it for me, and
      you might write to him once a week, without infringing on the time
      necessary for your duties here. I wish to tell you also, that I think
      Annis is right. I have put both of you under restraints not needful, not
      supposable, even from my knowledge of both of you. Answer the letter
      according to your loyal, loving heart. Annis will understand by my utterly
      revoking the charge I gave you both, that I see my fault, and am sorry for
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Faith&rsquo;s head was on her father&rsquo;s shoulder, and she was clasped to his
      heart, and he kissed the silent happy tears from off her cheeks and went
      to the chapel with a heart at peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterward the squire went to call upon his son and he found him
      in his usual buoyant temper. &ldquo;Mother was anxious about thee, Dick. She
      says she has not seen thee for four or five days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been under the weather for a week, but I am all right now. Tell
      her I will come and dine with her to-night. What are you going to do with
      yourself to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll tell thee&mdash;Russell and Grey hev asked me to go to Hyde
      Park Gate and talk to the people, and keep them quiet, till parliament can
      fashion to get back to its place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are not the Easter holidays over yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The taking of holidays at this time was both a sin and a shame. The
      streets are full of men who are only wanting a leader and they would give
      king and lords and commons a long, long holiday. Earl Russell says I am
      the best man to manage them, and he hes asked by proclamation Yorkshire
      and Lancashire men to meet me, and talk over our program with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If tha wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may be quarreling and danger. I will not let you go alone. I must
      be at your side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, then, there is no &lsquo;must be.&rsquo; I can manage Yorkshire lads without
      anybody&rsquo;s help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What time do you speak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Tell mother I&rsquo;ll have my dinner with her and you at the
      Clarendon, and then we will go to interview the mob afterward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are not a mob. Doan&rsquo;t thee call them names. They are ivery one
      Englishmen, holding themsens with sinews of steel, from becoming mobs; but
      if they should, by any evil chance, become a mob, then, bless thee, lad,
      it would be well for thee and me to keep out of their way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble lies here,&rdquo; the squire continued,&mdash;&ldquo;these gatherings of
      men waiting to see The Bill passed that shall give them their rights, have
      been well taught by Earl Grey, Lord Russell, and Lord Brougham, but only
      fitfully, at times and seasons; but by day and night ivery day and Sunday,
      there hev been and there are chartists and socialist lecturers among them,
      putting bitter thoughts against their awn country into their hearts. And
      they&rsquo;re a soft lot. They believe all they are told, if t&rsquo; speaker but
      claim to be educated. Such precious nonsense!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, father, a good many really educated people go to lectures
      about what they call science and they, too, believe all that they are
      told.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll warrant them, Dick. Yet our Rector, when he paid us a visit last
      summer, told me emphatically, that science was a new kind of sin&mdash;a
      new kind of sin, that, and nothing more, or better! And I&rsquo;ll be bound thy
      mother will varry soon find it out and I&rsquo;m glad she hed the sense to keep
      Kitty away from such teachers. Just look at Brougham. He is making a
      perfect fool of himsen about tunneling under the Thames River and lighting
      cities with the gas we see sputtering out of our coal fires and carrying
      men in comfortable coaches thirty, ay, even forty, miles an hour by steam.
      Why Bingley told me, that he heard Brougham say he hoped to live to see
      men heving their homes in Norfolk or Suffolk villages, running up or down
      to London ivery day to do their business. Did tha iver hear such nonsense,
      Dick? And when men who publish books and sit on the government benches
      talk it, what can you expect from men who don&rsquo;t know their alphabet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have an easier fight than I have, sir. Love and one woman, can be
      harder to win, than a thousand men for freedom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha knows nothing about it, if that is thy opinion,&rdquo; and the squire
      straightened himself, and stood up, and with a great deal of passion
      recited three fine lines from Byron, the favorite men&rsquo;s poet of that day:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;For Freedom&rsquo;s battle once begun,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Bequeathed by bleeding sire to son,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Though baffled oft, is always won!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those lines sound grandly in your mouth, dad,&rdquo; said Dick, as he looked
      with admiring love into his father&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I think they do. I hev been reciting them a good deal lately. They
      allays bring what t&rsquo; Methodists call &lsquo;the Amen&rsquo; from the audience. I don&rsquo;t
      care whether it is made up of rich men, or poor men, they fetch a ringing
      Amen from every heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think that climax would carry any meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it won&rsquo;t. The men I am going to address to-night doan&rsquo;t read; but
      they do think, and when a man hes drawn his conclusions from what he hes
      seen, and what he hes felt or experienced, they hev a bulldog grip on him.
      I will tell thee now, and keep mind of what I say&mdash;when tha hes to
      talk to fools, tha needs ivery bit of all the senses tha happens to hev.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, father, can I be of any use to you to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tha can not. Not a bit, not a word. Dick, thou belongs to the coming
      generation and they would see it and make thee feel it. Thy up-to-date
      dress would offend them. I shall go to t&rsquo; meeting in my leather breeches,
      and laced-up Blucher shoes, my hunting coat and waistcoat with dog head
      buttons, and my Madras red neckerchief. They will understand that dress.
      It will explain my connection with the land that we all of us belong to.
      Now be off with thee and I am glad to see thou hes got over thy last
      sweet-hearting so soon, and so easy. I thought thou wert surely in for a
      head-over-ears attack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, dad I and do not forget the three lines of poetry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not likely to forget them. No one loves a bit of poetry better than a
      Yorkshire weaver. Tha sees they were mostly brought up on Wesley&rsquo;s Hymn
      Book,&rdquo; and he was just going to recite the three lines again, but he saw
      Dick had turned towards the door and he let him go. &ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; he
      muttered, &ldquo;it is easy to make Youth see, but you can&rsquo;t make it believe.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Dick left his
      father he hardly knew what to do with himself. He was not prepared to
      speak to his mother, nor did he think it quite honorable to do so, until
      he had informed his father of Mr. Foster&rsquo;s change of heart, with regard to
      Faith and himself. His father had been his first confidant, and in this
      first confidence, there had been an implied promise, that his engagement
      to Faith was not yet to be made public.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick!&rdquo; the squire had said: &ldquo;Thou must for a little while do as most men
      hev to do; that is, keep thy happiness to thysen till there comes a wiser
      hour to talk about it. People scarcely sleep, or eat, the whole country is
      full of trouble and fearfulness; and mother and Jane are worried about
      Katherine and her sweethearts. She hes a new one, a varry likely man,
      indeed, the nephew of an earl and a member of a very rich banking firm.
      And Kitty is awkward and disobedient, and won&rsquo;t notice him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Kitty ought to have her own way, father. She has set her heart on
      Harry Bradley and no one can say a word against Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not, from thy point of view. Dick, it is a bit hard on a father
      and mother, when their children, tenderly loved and cared for, turn their
      backs on such love and go and choose love for themsens, even out of the
      house of their father&rsquo;s enemies. I feel it badly, Dick. I do that!&rdquo; And
      the squire looked so hopeless and sorrowful, Dick could not bear it. He
      threw his arm across his father&rsquo;s shoulder, and their hands met, and a few
      words were softly said, that brought back the ever ready smile to the
      squire&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is only thy mother,&rdquo; continued the squire, &ldquo;that I am anxious about.
      Kitty and Harry are in the same box as thysen; they will mebbe help thee
      to talk thy love hunger away. But I wouldn&rsquo;t say a word to thy aunt.
      However she takes it she will be apt to overdo hersen. It is only waiting
      till the Bill is passed and that will soon happen. Then we shall go home,
      and mother will be too busy getting her home in order, to make as big a
      worry of Faith, as she would do here, where Jane and thy aunt would do all
      they could to make the trouble bigger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dick went to look for Harry. He could not find him. A clerk at the
      Club told him he &ldquo;believed Mr. Bradley had gone to Downham Market in
      Norfolk,&rdquo; and Dick fretfully wondered what had taken Harry to Norfolk? And
      to Downham Market, of all the dull, little towns in that country. Finally,
      he concluded to go and see Kitty. &ldquo;She is a wise little soul,&rdquo; he thought,
      &ldquo;and she may have added up mother by this time.&rdquo; So he went to Lady
      Leyland&rsquo;s house and found Kitty and Harry Bradley taking lunch together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother and Jane are out with Aunt Josepha,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and Harry has just
      got back from Norfolk. I was sitting down to my lonely lunch when he came
      in, so he joined me. It is not much of a lunch. Jane asked me if a mutton
      patty-pie, and some sweet stuff would do, and I told her she could leave
      out the mutton pie, if she liked, but she said, &lsquo;Nonsense! someone might
      come in, who could not live on love and sugar.&rsquo; So the pies luckily came
      up, piping hot, for Harry. Some good little household angel always
      arranges things, if we trust to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What took you to Norfolk, Harry? Bird game on the Fens, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Business, only, took me there. We heard of a man who had some Jacquard
      looms to sell. I went to see them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I missed you very much. I am in a lot of trouble. Faith and I are
      engaged, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! I did not know that things had got that far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they have, and Mr. Foster behaved to us very unkindly at first, but
      he has seen his fault, and repented. And father was more set and obdurate
      than I thought he could be, under any circumstances; and I wanted your
      advice, Harry, and could not find you anywhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was it about Faith you wanted me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, I wanted to know what you would do if in my circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dick, Kitty and I are in a similar case and we have done nothing at
      all. We are just waiting, until Destiny does for us what we should only do
      badly, if we tried to move in the matter before the proper time. I should
      personally think this particular time would not be a fortunate hour for
      seeking recognition for a marriage regarded as undesirable on either, or
      both sides. I am sorry you troubled your father just at this time, for I
      fear he has already a great trouble to face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father a great trouble to face! What do you mean, Harry? Have you
      heard anything? Is mother all right? Kitty, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had heard of nothing wrong when mother and Jane went out to-day. Harry
      is not ten minutes in the house. We had hardly finished saying good
      afternoon to each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not intend to say anything to Kitty, as I judged it to be a trouble
      the squire must bear alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no! The squire&rsquo;s wife and children will bear it with him. Speak out,
      Harry. Whatever the trouble is, it cannot be beyond our bearing and
      curing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, Dick, the new scheme of boroughs decided on by the Reform
      Bill will deprive the squire of his seat in Parliament, as Annis borough
      has been united with Bradley borough, which also takes in Thaxton village.
      Now if the Bill passes, there will be a general election, and there is a
      decided move, in that case, to elect my father as representative for the
      united seats.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nothing to worry about,&rdquo; answered Dick with a nonchalant tone and
      manner. &ldquo;My dad has represented them for thirty years. I believe
      grandfather sat for them, even longer. I dare be bound dad will be glad to
      give his seat to anybody that hes the time to bother with it; it is
      nothing but trouble and expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so? I thought it represented both honor and profit,&rdquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it may do! I do not think father cares a button about what honor and
      profit it possesses. However, I am going to look after father now, and,
      Kitty, if the circumstances should in the least be a trouble to father, I
      shall expect you to stand loyally by your father and the family.&rdquo; With
      these words he went away, without further courtesies, unless a proud
      upward toss of his handsome head could be construed into a parting salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments of intense silence followed. Katherine&rsquo;s cheeks were flushed
      and her eyes cast down. Harry looked anxiously at her. He expected some
      word, either of self-dependence, or of loyalty to her pledge of a supreme
      love for himself; but she made neither, and was&mdash;Harry considered&mdash;altogether
      unsatisfactory. At this moment he expected words of loving constancy, or
      at least some assurance of the stability of her affection. On the
      contrary, her silence and her cold manner, gave him a heart shock. &ldquo;Kitty!
      My darling Kitty! did you hear, did you understand, what Dick said, what
      he meant?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I both heard and understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then, what was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He meant, that if my father was hurt, or offended by his removal from his
      seat in The House, he would make father&rsquo;s quarrel his own and expect me to
      do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you would not do such a thing as that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not see how I could help it. I love my father. It is beyond words to
      say how dear he is to me. It would be an impossibility for me to avoid
      sympathizing with him. Mother and Dick would do the same. Aunt Josepha and
      even Jane and Ley-land, would make father&rsquo;s wrong their own; and you must
      know how Yorkshire families stand together even if the member of it in
      trouble is unworthy of the least consideration. Remember the Traffords!
      They were all made poor by Jack, and Jack&rsquo;s wife, but they would not
      listen to a word against them. That is <i>our</i> way, you know it. To
      every Yorkshire man and woman Kindred is Kin, and Love is Love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they put love before kindred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they do, and perhaps they do not. I have never seen anyone put
      strangers before kindred. I would despise anyone who did such a thing.
      Yes, indeed, I would!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father knows how devotedly we love each other, even from our
      childhood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, he has always treated our love as a very childish affair. He
      looks upon me yet, as far too young to even think of marrying. He has been
      expecting me during this season in London, to meet someone or other by
      whom I could judge whether my love for you was not a childish imagination.
      You have known this, Harry, all the time we have been sweethearts. When I
      was nine, and you were twelve, both father and mother used to laugh at our
      childish love-making.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if I understand you, Kitty! Are you beginning to break your
      promise to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I wished to break my promise to you, I should not do so in any
      underhand kind of way. Half-a-dozen clear, strong words would do. I should
      not understand any other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very miserable. Your look and your attitude frighten me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry, I never before saw you act so imprudently and unkindly. No one
      likes the bringer of ill news. I was expecting a happy hour with you and
      Dick; and you scarcely allowed Dick to bid me a good afternoon, until you
      out with your bad news&mdash;and there was a real tone of triumph in your
      voice. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t wonder that Dick felt angry and astonished.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Kitty, I thought it the best opportunity possible to tell you
      about the proposed new borough. I felt sure, both you and Dick would
      remember my uncertain, and uncomfortable position, and give me your
      assurance of my claim. It is a very hard position for me to be in, and I
      am in no way responsible for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do not think your position is any harder than mine and I am as innocent&mdash;perhaps
      a great deal more innocent&mdash;of aiding on the situation as you can
      be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you intend to give me up if your father and Dick tell you to do so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the question. I say distinctly, that I consider your hurry to
      tells the news of your father&rsquo;s possible substitution in the squire&rsquo;s
      parliamentary seat, was impolite and unnecessary just yet, and that your
      voice and manner were in some unhappy way offensive. I felt them to be so,
      and I do not take offense without reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me explain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I do not wish to hear any more on the subject at present. And I will
      remind you that the supplanting of Squire Annis is as yet problematic. Was
      there any necessity for you to rush news which is dependent on the passing
      of a Bill, that has been loitering in parliament for forty years, and
      before a general election was certain? It was this hurry and your
      uncontrollable air of satisfaction, which angered Dick&mdash;and myself:&rdquo;&mdash;and
      with these words, said with a great deal of quiet dignity, she bid Harry
      &ldquo;good afternoon&rdquo; and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Harry was dumb with sorrow and amazement. He made no effort to detain
      her, and when she reached the next floor, she heard the clash of the main
      door follow his hurrying footsteps. &ldquo;It is all over! All over!!&rdquo; she said
      and then tried to comfort herself, with a hearty fit of crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry went to his club and thought the circumstance over, but he hastily
      followed a suggestion, which was actually the most foolish move he could
      have made&mdash;he resolved to go and tell Madam Temple the whole
      circumstance. He believed that she had a real liking for him and would be
      glad to put his side of the trouble in its proper light. She had always
      sympathized with his love for Katherine and he believed that she would see
      nothing wrong in his gossip about the squire&rsquo;s position. So he went to
      Madam at once and found her in her office with her confidential lawyer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then?&rdquo; she asked, in her most authoritative manner, &ldquo;what brings
      thee here, in the middle of the day&rsquo;s business? Hes thou no business in
      hand? No sweetheart to see? No book or paper to read?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came to you, Madam, for advice; but I see that you are too busy to care
      for my perplexities.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go into the small parlor and I will come to thee in ten minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice and manner admitted of no dispute, and Harry&mdash;inwardly
      chafing at his own obedience&mdash;went to the small parlor and waited. As
      yet he could not see any reason for Dick&rsquo;s and Katherine&rsquo;s unkind
      treatment of him. He felt sure Madam Temple would espouse his side of the
      question, and also persuade Katherine that Dick had been unjustly
      offended. But his spirits fell the moment she entered the room. The
      atmosphere of money and the market-place was still around her and she
      asked sharply&mdash;&ldquo;Whativer is the matter with thee, Harry Bradley? Tell
      me quickly. I am more than busy to-day, and I hev no time for nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than nonsense, Madam, or I would not trouble you. I only want
      a little of your good sense to help me out of a mess I have got into with&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Katherine, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With Dick also.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. If you offended one, you would naturally offend the other.
      Make as few words as thou can of the affair.&rdquo; This order dashed Harry at
      the beginning of the interview, and Madam&rsquo;s impassive and finally angry
      face gave him no help in detailing his grievance. Throughout his complaint
      she made no remark, no excuse, neither did she offer a word of sympathy.
      Finally he could no longer continue his tale of wrong, its monotony grew
      intolerable, even to himself, and he said passionately&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see that you have neither sympathy nor counsel to give me, Madam. I am
      sorry I troubled you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, thou ought to be ashamed as well as sorry. Thou that reckons to know
      so much and yet cannot see that tha hes been guilty of an almost
      unpardonable family crime. Thou hed no right to say a word that would
      offend anyone in the Annis family. The report might be right, or it might
      be wrong, I know not which; but it was all wrong for thee to clap thy
      tongue on it. The squire has said nothing to me about thy father taking
      his place in the House of Commons, and I wouldn&rsquo;t listen to anyone else,
      not even thysen. I think the young squire and Katherine treated thee a
      deal better than thou deserved. After a bit of behavior like thine, it
      wasn&rsquo;t likely they would eat another mouthful with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth, Madam, is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even if it hed been ten times the truth, it should hev been a lie to
      thee. Thou ought to hev felled it, even on the lips speaking it. I think
      nothing of love and friendship that won&rsquo;t threep for a friend, right or
      wrong, for or against, true or untrue. I am varry much disappointed in
      thee, Mr. Harry Bradley, and the sooner thou leaves me, the better I&rsquo;ll be
      pleased.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Madam, you utterly confound me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou ought to be confounded and I would be a deal harder on thee if I did
      not remember that thou hes no family behind thee whose honor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, I have my father behind me, and a nobler man does not exist. He is
      any man&rsquo;s peer. I know no other man fit to liken him to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right. Stand by thy father. And remember that the Annis family hes
      to stand up for a few centuries of Annis fathers. Go to thy father and
      bide with him. His advice will suit thee better than mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think Dick might have understood me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick understood thee well enough. Dick was heart hurt by thy evident
      pleasure with the news that was like a hot coal in thy mouth. It pleased
      thee so well thou couldn&rsquo;t keep it for a fitting hour. Not thou! Thy
      vanity will make a heart ache for my niece, no doubt she will be worried
      beyond all by thy behavior, but I&rsquo;ll warrant she will not go outside her
      own kith and kin for advice or comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, forgive my ignorance. I ask you that much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is a different thing. I can forgive thee, where I couldn&rsquo;t
      help thee&mdash;not for my life. But thou ought to suffer for such a bit
      of falsity, and I hope thou wilt suffer. I do that! Now I can&rsquo;t stay with
      thee any longer, but I do wish thou hed proved thysen more right-hearted,
      and less set up with a probability. In plain truth, that is so. And I&rsquo;ll
      tell the one sure thing&mdash;if thou hopes to live in Yorkshire, stand by
      Yorkshire ways, and be leal and loyal to thy friends, rich or poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, Madam, to be leal and loyal to all men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just a bit of general overdoing. It was a sharp wisdom in Jesus
      Christ, when he told us not to love all humanity, but to love our
      neighbor. He knew that was about all we could manage. It is above what I
      can manage this afternoon, so I&rsquo;ll take my leave of thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry left the house almost stupefied by the storm of anger his vanity and
      his pride in his father&rsquo;s probable honor, had caused him. But when he
      reached his room in The Yorkshire Club and had closed the door on all
      outside influences, a clear revelation came to him, and he audibly
      expressed it as he walked angrily about the floor:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate that pompous old squire! He never really liked me&mdash;thought I
      was not good enough for his daughter&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll be glad if he hes to
      sit a bit lower&mdash;and I&rsquo;m right glad father is going a bit higher.
      Father is full fit for it. So he is! but oh, Katherine! Oh, Kitty! Kitty!
      What shall I do without you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, Dick had decided that he would say nothing about the
      squire&rsquo;s probable rival for the new borough, until the speech to be made
      that evening had been delivered. It might cause him to say something
      premature and unadvised. When he came to this conclusion he was suddenly
      aware that he had left his lunch almost untouched on his sister&rsquo;s table,
      and that he was naturally hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No wonder I feel out of sorts!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;I will go to The Yorkshire
      and have a decent lunch. Kitty might have known better than offer me
      anything out of a patty-pan. I&rsquo;ll go and get some proper eating and then
      I&rsquo;ll maybe have some sensible thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He put this purpose into action at once by going to The Yorkshire Club and
      ordering a beefsteak with fresh shalots, a glass of port wine, and bread
      and cheese, and having eaten a satisfying meal, he went to his room and
      wrote a long letter to Faith, illustrating it with his own suspicions and
      reflections. This letter he felt to be a very clever move. He told himself
      that Faith would relate the story to her father and that Mr. Foster would
      say and do the proper thing much more wisely and effectively than anyone
      else could.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know the exact hour at which his father was to meet some of the
      weavers and workers of Annis locality, but he thought if he reached the
      rendezvous about nine o&rsquo;clock he would be in time to hear any discussion
      there might be, and walk to the Clarendon with his father after it. This
      surmise proved correct, for as he reached the designated place, he saw the
      crowd, and heard his father speaking to it. Another voice appeared to be
      interrupting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick listened a moment, and then ejaculated, &ldquo;Yes! Yes! That is father
      sure enough! He is bound to have a threep with somebody.&rdquo; Then he walked
      quicker, and soon came in sight of the crowd of men surrounding the
      speaker, who stood well above them, on the highest step of a granite
      stairway leading into a large building.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Dick knew well that his father was a very handsome man, but he thought
      he had never before noticed it so clearly, for at this hour Antony Annis
      was something more than a handsome man&mdash;he was an inspired orator.
      His large, beautiful countenance was beaming and glowing with life and
      intellect; but it was also firm as steel, for he had a clear purpose
      before him, and he looked like a drawn sword. The faces of the crowd were
      lifted to him&mdash;roughly-sketched, powerful faces, with well-lifted
      foreheads, and thick brown hair, crowned in nearly every case with labor&rsquo;s
      square, uncompromising, upright paper cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire had turned a little to the right, and was addressing an Annis
      weaver called Jonas Shuttleworth. &ldquo;Jonas Shuttleworth!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;does
      tha know what thou art saying? How dare tha talk in this nineteenth
      century of Englishmen fighting Englishmen? They can only do that thing at
      the instigation of the devil. <i>Why-a!</i> thou might as well talk of
      fighting thy father and mother! As for going back to old ways, and old
      times, none of us can do it, and if we could do it, we should be far from
      suited with the result. You hev all of you now seen the power loom at
      work; would you really like the old cumbrous hand-loom in your homes
      again? You know well you wouldn&rsquo;t stand it. A time is close at hand when
      we shall all of us hev to cut loose from our base. I know that. I shall
      hev to do it. You will hev to do it. Ivery man that hes any <i>forthput</i>
      in him will hev to do it. Those who won&rsquo;t do it must be left behind,
      sticking in the mud made by the general stir up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be hard lines, squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you all take it like &lsquo;Mr. Content&rsquo; at your new loom. For I tell
      you the even down truth, when I say&mdash;You, and your ways, and your
      likings, will all hev to be <i>born over again!</i> Most of you here are
      Methodists and you know what that means. The things you like best you&rsquo;ll
      hev to give them up and learn to be glad and to fashion yoursens to ways
      and works, which just now you put under your feet and out of your
      consideration.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your straight meaning, squire? We want to understand thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well and good! I mean this&mdash;You hev allays been &lsquo;slow and sure&rsquo;; in
      the new times just here, you&rsquo;ll hev to be &lsquo;up and doing,&rsquo; for you will
      find it a big hurry-push to keep step with your new work-fellows, steam
      and machinery.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is more than a man can do, squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it is not! A man can do anything he thinks it worth his while to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>London Times</i>, sir, said yesterday that it would take all of
      another generation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will do nothing of the kind, Sam Yates. What-iver has thou to do with
      the newspapers? Newspapers! Don&rsquo;t thee mind them! Their advice is meant to
      be read, not taken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Labor, squire, hes its rights&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure, labor also hes its duties. It isn&rsquo;t much we hear about the
      latter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rights and duties, squire. The Reform Bill happens to be both. When is
      The Bill to be settled?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing is settled, Sam, until it is settled right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Brougham, in a speech at Manchester, told us he would see it settled
      this session.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord Brougham thinks in impossibilities. He would make a contract with
      Parliament to govern England, or even Ireland. Let me tell thee all
      government is a thing of necessity, not of choice. England will not for
      any Bill dig under her foundations. Like Time, she destroys even great
      wrongs slowly. Her improvements hev to grow and sometimes they take a good
      while about it. You hev been crying for this Bill for forty years, you
      were not ready for it then. Few of you at that time hed any education.
      Now, many of your men can read and a lesser number write. Such men as
      Grey, Russell, Brougham and others hev led and taught you, and there&rsquo;s no
      denying that you hev been varry apt scholars. Take your improvements
      easily, Sam. You won&rsquo;t make any real progress by going over precipices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, we at least hev truth on our side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Truth can only be on one side, Sam, I&rsquo;m well pleased if you hev it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, squire, but I can tell you this&mdash;if Parliament doesn&rsquo;t
      help us varry soon now we will help oursens.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is what you ought to be doing right now. Get agate, men! Go to your
      new loom, and make yersens masters of it. I will promise you in that case,
      that your new life will be, on the whole, better than the old one. As for
      going back to the old life, you can&rsquo;t do it. Not for your immortal souls!
      Time never runs back to fetch any age of gold; and as for making a living
      in the old way and with the old hand loom, you may as well sow corn in the
      sea, and hope to reap it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire, I want to get out of a country where its rulers can stop minding
      its desperate poverty, and can forget that it is on the edge of rebellion,
      and in the grip of some death they call cholera, and go home for their
      Easter holiday, quite satisfied with themsens. We want another Oliver
      Cromwell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we don&rsquo;t either. The world won&rsquo;t be ready for another Cromwell, not
      for a thousand years maybe. Such men are only born at the rate of one in a
      millennium.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s a millennium, squire?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand years, lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There wer&rsquo; men of the right kind in Cromwell&rsquo;s day to stand by him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our fathers were neither better nor worse than oursens, Sam, just about
      thy measure, and my measure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t know, sir. They fought King and Parliament, and got all they
      wanted. Then they went over seas and founded a big republic, and all hes
      gone well with them&mdash;and we could do the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, you hev been doing something like the same thing iver since
      Cromwell lived. Your people are busy at the same trade now. The English
      army is made up of working men. They are usually thrown in ivery part of
      the world, taking a sea port, or a state, or a few fertile islands that
      are lying loose and uncivilized in the southern seas. They do this for the
      glory and profit of England and in such ways they hev made pagans live
      like Christians, and taught people to obey the just laws of England, that
      hed niver before obeyed a decent law of any kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t get for their work what Cromwell&rsquo;s men got.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t deserve it. Your mark can&rsquo;t touch Cromwell&rsquo;s mark; it was far
      above your reach. Your object is mainly a selfish one. You want more
      money, more power, and you want to do less work than you iver did.
      Cromwell&rsquo;s men wanted one thing first and chiefly&mdash;the liberty to
      worship God according to their conscience. They got what they wanted for
      their day and generation, and before they settled in America, they made a
      broad path ready for John Wesley. Yes, indeed, Oliver Cromwell made John
      Wesley possible. Now, when you go to the wonderful new loom that hes been
      invented for you, and work it cheerfully, you&rsquo;ll get your Bill, and all
      other things reasonable that you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Parliament men are so everlastingly slow, squire,&rdquo; said an old man
      sitting almost at the squire&rsquo;s feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is God&rsquo;s truth, friend. They <i>are</i> slow. It is the English way.
      You are slow yoursens. So be patient and keep busy learning your trade in
      a newer and cleverer way. I am going to bide in London till Parliament
      says, <i>Yes or No</i>. Afterwards I&rsquo;ll go back to Annis, and learn a new
      life.&rdquo; Then some man on the edge of the crowd put up his hand, and the
      squire asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose cap is speaking now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Israel Kinsman&rsquo;s, sir. Thou knaws me, squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I do. What does tha want to say? And when did tha get home
      from America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A matter of a year ago. I hev left the army and gone back to my loom. Now
      I want to ask thee, if thou are against men when they are oppressed
      fighting for their rights and their freedom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I! Men, even under divine guidance, hev taken that sharp road many
      times. The God who made iron knew men would make swords of it&mdash;just
      as He also knew they would make plowshares. Making war is sometimes the
      only way to make peace. If the cause is a just one the Lord calls himself
      the God of battles. He knows, and we know, that

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, men, there is no use in discussing a situation not likely to trouble
      England in this nineteenth century. I believe the world is growing better
      constantly, and that eventually all men will do, or cause to be done,
      whatever is square, straight and upright, as the caps on your heads. I
      believe it, because the good men will soon be so immensely in excess that
      bad men will <i>hev</i> to do right, and until that day comes, we will go

      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a truth, men, you may all of you cap to,&rdquo; and as the squire
      lifted his riding cap high above his head, more than two hundred paper
      caps followed it, accompanied by a long, joyful shout for the good time
      promised, and certainly coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, men,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;let us see what &lsquo;cap money&rsquo; we can collect
      for those who are poor and helpless. Israel Naylor and John Moorby will
      collect it. It will go for the spreading of the children&rsquo;s table in Leeds
      and Israel will see it gets safely there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll hev thy cap, squire,&rdquo; said Israel. &ldquo;The man who proposes a cap
      collection salts his awn cap with his awn money first.&rdquo; And the squire
      laughed good-humoredly, lifted his cap, and in their sight dropped five
      gold sovereigns into it. Then Dick offered his hat to his father, saying
      he had his opera hat in his pocket and the two happy men went away
      together, just as some musical genius had fitted Byron&rsquo;s three lines to a
      Methodist long-metre, so they were followed by little groups straying off
      in different directions, and all singing,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;For Freedom&rsquo;s battle once begun,

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick did not enter the Clarendon with his father. He knew that he might be
      a little superfluous. The squire had a certain childlike egotism which
      delighted in praising himself, and in telling his own story; and Annie was
      audience sufficient. If she approved, there was no more to be desired, the
      third person was often in the way. In addition to this wish to give the
      squire the full measure of his success, Dick was longing passionately to
      be with his love and his hopes. The squire would not speak of Faith, and
      Dick wanted to talk about her. Her name beat upon his lips, and oh, how he
      longed to see her! To draw her to his side, to touch her hair, her eyes,
      her lips! He told himself that the promise of silence until the Bill was
      passed, or thrown out was a great wrong, that he never ought to have made
      it, that his father never ought to have asked for it. He wondered how he
      was to get the time over; the gayeties of London had disappeared, the
      Leylands thought it prudent to live quietly, his mother and Katherine were
      tired of the city, and longed to be at home; and Harry, whose sympathy he
      had always relied on, was somewhere in Norfolk, and had not even taken the
      trouble to write and tell him the reason for his visit, to such a tame,
      bucolic county.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet with the hope of frequent letters, and his own cheerful optimistic
      temper, he managed to reach the thirtieth of May. On that morning he took
      breakfast with his parents, and the squire said in a positive voice that
      he was &ldquo;sure the Bill would pass the House of Lords before May became
      June; and if you remember the events since the seventh of April, Dick, you
      will also be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I do not remember much about public affairs during that time, father.
      I was in Annis, and here and there, and in every place it was confusion
      and anger and threats. I really do not remember them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou ought to, and thou may as well sit still, and let me tell thee
      some things thou should niver forget.&rdquo; But as the squire&rsquo;s method was
      discursive, and often interrupted by questions and asides from Mistress
      Annis and Dick, facts so necessary may be told without such delay, and
      also they will be more easily remembered by the reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping in mind then that Parliament adjourned at seven o&rsquo;clock in the
      morning, on April fourteenth until the seventh of May, it is first to be
      noted that during this three weeks&rsquo; vacation there was an incessant
      agitation, far more formidable than fire, rioting, and the destruction of
      property. Petitions from every populous place to King William entreated
      him to create a sufficient number of peers to pass the Bill <i>in spite of
      the old peers</i>. The Press, nearly a unit, urged as the most vital and
      necessary thing the immediate passage of the Bill, predicting a United
      Rebellion of England, Scotland and Ireland, if longer delayed. On the
      seventh of May, the day Parliament reassembled, there was the largest
      public meeting that had ever been held in Great Britain, and with heads
      uncovered, and faces lifted to heaven, the crowd took the following oath:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>With unbroken faith through every peril and privation, we here devote
      ourselves and our children to our country&rsquo;s cause!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This great public meeting included all the large political unions, and its
      solemn enthusiasm was remarkable for the same fervor and zeal of the old
      Puritan councils. Its solemn oath was taken while Parliament was
      reassembling in its two Houses. On that afternoon the House of Lords took
      up first the disfranchising of the boroughs, and a week of such intense
      excitement followed, as England had not seen since the Revolution of 1688.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the eighth of May, Parliament asked the King to sanction a large
      creation of new peers. The king angrily refused his assent. The ministers
      then tendered their resignation. It was accepted. On the evening of the
      ninth, their resignation was announced to the Lords and Commons. On the
      eleventh Lord Ebrington moved that &ldquo;the House should express to the King
      their deep distress at a change of ministers, and entreat him only to call
      to his councils such persons as would carry through <i>The Bill</i> with
      all its demands unchanged and unimpaired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This motion was carried, and then for one week the nation was left to its
      conjectures, to its fears, and to its anger at the attitude of the
      government. Indeed for this period England was without a government. The
      Cabinet had resigned, leaving not a single officer who would join the
      cabinet which the king had asked the Duke of Wellington to form. In every
      city and town there were great meetings that sent petitions to the House
      of Commons, praying that it would grant no supplies of any kind to the
      government until the Bill was passed without change or mutilation. A
      petition was signed in Manchester by twenty-three thousand persons in
      three hours, and the deputy who brought it informed the Commons that the
      whole north of England was in a state of indignation impossible to
      describe. Asked if the people would fight, he answered, &ldquo;They will first
      of all demand that Parliament stop all government supplies&mdash;the tax
      gatherer will not be able to collect a penny. All civil tribunals will be
      defied, public credit shaken, property insecure, the whole frame of
      society will hasten to dissolution, and great numbers of our wealthiest
      families will transfer their homes to America.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lord Wellington utterly failed in all his attempts to form a ministry, Sir
      Robert Peel refused to make an effort to do so, and on the fifteenth of
      May it was announced in both Houses, that &ldquo;the ministers had resumed their
      communication with his majesty.&rdquo; On the eighteenth Lord Grey said in the
      House of Lords that &ldquo;he expected to carry the Reform Bill unimpaired and
      immediately.&rdquo; Yet on the day before this statement, Brougham and Grey had
      an interview with the King, in which his majesty exhibited both rudeness
      and ill-temper. He kept the two peers standing during the whole interview,
      a discourtesy contrary to usage. Both Grey and Brougham told the King that
      they would not return to office unless he promised to create the necessary
      number of peers to insure the passage of the Reform Bill just as it stood;
      and the King consented so reluctantly that Brougham asked for his
      permission in writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion of these facts occupied the whole morning and after an
      early lunch the squire prepared to go to The House; then Dick noticed that
      even after he was hatted and coated for his visit, he kept delaying about
      very trivial things. So he resolved to carry out his part of their secret
      arrangement, and remove himself from all temptation to tell his mother he
      was going to marry Faith Foster. His father understood the lad so like
      himself, and Dick knew what his father feared. So he bid his mother
      good-by, and accompanied his father to the street. There the latter said
      plainly, &ldquo;Thou did wisely, Dick. If I hed left thee alone with thy mother,
      thou would hev told her all that thou knew, and thought, and believed, and
      hoped, and expected from Faith. Thou couldn&rsquo;t hev helped it&mdash;and I
      wouldn&rsquo;t hev blamed thee.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LTHOUGH Dick
      pretended an utter disbelief in Grey&rsquo;s prophecy, it really came true; and
      the Reform Bill passed the House of Lords on the last day of May. Then the
      Annis family were in haste to return home. The feeling of being on a
      pleasure visit was all past and gone, and the bare certainties and
      perplexities of life confronted them. For the first time in all his days,
      the squire felt anxious about money matters, and actually realized that he
      was going to be scrimped in coin for his household expenses. This fact
      shocked him, he could hardly believe it. Annie, however, knew nothing of
      this dilemma and when her husband spoke of an immediate return home, said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad we are going home. To-morrow, I will see my dressmaker and
      finish my shopping;&rdquo; and the squire looked at her with such anxious eyes
      that she immediately added&mdash;&ldquo;unless, Antony, thou would like me to
      pack my trunks at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would like that, Annie. It would help me above a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. Kitty is ready to start at any hour. She wants to go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with Kitty? She isn&rsquo;t like hersen lately? Is she
      sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think there is a little falling out between Harry and her. That is
      common enough in all love affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here a servant entered with a letter and gave it to the squire. He looked
      at it a moment and then said to his wife&mdash;&ldquo;It is from Josepha. She
      wants to see me varry particular, and hopes I will come to her at once.
      She thinks I had better drop in for dinner and says she will wait for me
      until half-past five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just like her unreasonableness. If she knows the Bill is passed,
      she must know also that we are packing, and as busy as we can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she does not know that the great event has happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is nonsense. Half a dozen people would send her word, or run with
      the news themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Annie, she is my only sister, and she is varry like my mother. I
      must give her an hour. I could not be happy if I did not;&rdquo; and there was
      something in the tone of his voice which Annie knew she need not try to
      alter. So she wisely acquiesced in his resolve, pitying him the while for
      having the claims of three women to satisfy. But the squire went
      cheerfully enough to his sister. The claims of kindred were near and dear
      to him and a very sincere affection existed between him and his sister
      Jo-sepha. She was waiting for him. She was resolved to have a talk with
      him about the Bradleys, and she had a proposal to make, a proposal on
      which she had set her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she met him at the open door, and said&mdash;with a tight clasp of his
      big hand&mdash;&ldquo;I am right glad to see thee, brother. Come in here,&rdquo; and
      she led him to a small parlor used exclusively by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot stop to dinner, Josey,&rdquo; he said kindly, but he kept her hand in
      his hand, until he reached the chair his sister pointed out. Then she sat
      down beside him and said, &ldquo;Antony, my dear brother, thou must answer me a
      few questions. If thou went home and left me in doubt, I should be a varry
      unhappy woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whativer art thou bothering thysen about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About thee. I&rsquo;ll speak out plain and thou must answer me in the same
      fashion. What is tha going to do about thy living? Thou hes no business
      left, and I know well thou hes spent lavishly iver since thou came here
      with thy wife and daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I hev. And they are varry welcome to ivery penny of the
      outlay. And I must say, Josey, thou has been more extravagant about both
      Annie and Kitty than I hev been.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well then Kitty is such a darling&mdash;thou knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, she is that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Annie is more tolerant with me than she iver was before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Iveryone gets more kindly as he grows older. And she knaws
      thee better, which is a great deal. Annie is good from the beginning to
      the end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody will say different, but that is not what I am wanting to talk to
      thee about. Listen to me now, my dear lad! What art thou going to do? I am
      in earnest anxiety. Tell me, my brother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire was silent and looked steadily down on the table for a few
      minutes. Josepha did not by the slightest movement interfere but her
      steady, kindly gaze was fixed upon the silent man. Perhaps he felt, though
      he did not see, the love that shone upon him, for he lifted his face with
      a broad smile, and answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear lass, I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder. Now speak straight words to me as plain as thou spoke
      to the Annis weavers last week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear sister, I shall do right, and let come what will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what does tha call doing right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think of two ways and both seem right to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are they? Perhaps I can help thee to decide that one is better than
      the other. Dear lad, I want to help thee to do the best thing possible for
      thysen, and thy children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no resisting the persuasion in her face, voice and manner, and
      the squire could not resist its influence. &ldquo;Josey,&rdquo; he said, as he covered
      her small plump hand with his own in a very masterful way&mdash;&ldquo;Josey!
      Josey! I am in the thick of a big fight with mysen. I did really promise a
      crowd of Annis weavers that if the Reform Bill passed I would build a mill
      and give them all work, and that would let them come home again. Tha sees,
      they all own, or partly own, their cottages, and if I can&rsquo;t find them
      work, they will hev to give up their homes mebbe, to a varry great
      disadvantage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be plain with thee, thou could in such a case, buy them all back for a
      song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does tha really think thou hes an up and down blackguard for thy brother?
      I&rsquo;m not thinking of buying poor men&rsquo;s houses for a song&mdash;nor yet of
      buying them at any price.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A perfectly fair price, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There could not be a fair price under such conditions. The poor would
      be bound to get the worst of the bargain, unless I ruined mysen to be
      square and just. I doan&rsquo;t want to sit in hell, trying to count up what I
      hed made by buying poor men&rsquo;s homes at a bargain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hes tha any plan that will help thee to build a mill and give thy old
      weavers a chance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The government will loan to old employers money to help them build a
      mill, and so give work and bread.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The government is not lending money, except with some excellent
      security.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Land, I have plenty. I could spare some land.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Thou could not spare the government one acre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I cannot build a mill and furnish it with looms and all necessary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, thou can easily do it&mdash;if thou wilt take a partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does tha know anyone suitable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I know the person?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varry well. It is mysen. It is Josepha Temple.&rdquo; The squire fairly
      started. He looked straight into Josepha&rsquo;s eyes and she continued, &ldquo;Take
      me for thy partner, Antony. I will build thee the biggest, and most
      completely finished mill in the West Riding&mdash;or anywhere else&mdash;cotton
      or wool&mdash;whichiver thou likes. Bradley&rsquo;s is mainly cotton, thou hed
      better stick to wool. Thou hes two hundred sheep of thy awn, on thy awn
      fells, and wold. Stick to the wool, dear lad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Art thou in very earnest, Josepha?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure as life and death! I am in earnest. Say the word, and I&rsquo;ll build,
      and fit the mill, just as tha wants it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And thy share in it will be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will divide equally&mdash;half and half. I want to buy a partnership
      with my money. &lsquo;<i>Annis and Temple</i>&rsquo; will suit me well. I will find
      all the wherewithal required&mdash;money for building, looms, engines,
      wool or cotton yarns, just as thou wishes. Thou must give the land, and
      the varry best bit of land for the purpose, that thou hes on thy estate in
      Annis, or elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dost tha knaw how much money tha will hev to spend for what thou
      proposes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think I do and it will every farthing of it be Annis money. I
      hev speculated, and dealt wisely with the money the good Admiral left me.
      I hev made, made mysen, more money than we shall require for the mill and
      all its necessary furniture, and if it was not enough, I could double it
      and not feel a pound poorer. The outlay is mine, all of it; the land, and
      the management is thy affair. It is only by my name, which is well known
      among monied men, that I shall appear in the business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josepha! Thou art my good angel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am thy sister. We are both Annis folk. We were both rooted in the soil
      of this bit of England. We had the same good father and mother, the same
      church, and the same dear old home. God forbid we should iver forget that!
      No, we can not! These memories run with our blood, and throb in our
      hearts. All that is mine is thine. Thou art dear to me as my awn life. Thy
      son and daughter are my son and daughter. My money is thy money, to its
      last penny. Now, wilt thou hev me for thy partner?&rdquo; The squire had buried
      his face in his hands, and Josepha knew he was hiding his feelings from
      everyone but God, and she stepped to the window and drew up the shade, and
      let the sunshine flood the room. As she did so, the squire called to
      himself&mdash;&ldquo;Be of good courage, Antony!&rdquo; And he rose quickly, and so
      met his sister coming back to her chair, and took her in his arms, and
      kissed her and said: &ldquo;Josey, dear, there was a load on my heart I was
      hardly able to bear; thou hes lifted it, and I love and thank thee! We
      will work together, and we will show Yorkshire that landed gentlefolk can
      do a bit of business, above all their ideas, and above all thou can
      imagine it pleases me, that I may then redeem my promises to the men that
      hev worked so long, and so faithfully for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then it was Josepha that had to dry her eyes as she said: &ldquo;Thy kiss,
      Antony, was worth all I hev promised. It was the signing of our contract.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt, Josey, when I entered this house, that my life had come to an
      end, and that I could only write &lsquo;defeated&rsquo; over it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy real life begins at this hour. Thy really fine business faculties,
      corroded with rust and dust of inaction, will yet shine like new silver.
      There is no defeat, except from within. And the glad way in which thou can
      look forward, and take up a life so different to that thou hes known for
      more than fifty years, shows plainly that you can, and will, redeem every
      fault of the old life. As thou art so busy and bothered to-night, come
      to-morrow and I will hev my lawyer, and banker, also a first rate factory
      architect, here to meet thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At what hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From ten o&rsquo;clock to half-past twelve are my business hours. If that time
      is too short, we will lengthen it a bit. Dick has asked me to tell thee
      something thou ought to know, but which he cannot talk to thee about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it about Faith Foster?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not it! Varry different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, or who, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John Thomas Bradley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t thee say a word about the man. Thy words hev been so good, so
      wonderfully good, that I will not hev meaner ones mixed up with them. They
      may come to-morrow after law and money talk, but not after thy loving,
      heartening promises. No! No!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, go home and tell Annie, and let that weary Reform Bill
      business drop out of thy mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reform was a great need. It was a good thing to see it come, and Grey and
      Brougham hev proved themsens to be great men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t deny it, and it is allays so ordered, that in all times, great
      men can do great things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a light heart and a quick step the squire hurried back to the
      Clarendon. He had been given to drink of the elixir of life, the joy of
      work, the pleasure of doing great good to many others, the feeling that he
      was going to redeem his lost years. He had not walked with such a light
      purposeful step for twenty years, and Annie was amazed when she heard it.
      She was still more amazed when she heard him greet some acquaintance whom
      he met in the corridor. Now Annie had resolved to be rather cool and
      silent with her husband. He had overstayed his own time nearly two hours,
      and she thought he ought to be made to feel the enormity of such a
      delinquency; especially, when he was hurrying their departure, though she
      had yet a great many little things to attend to.
    </p>
    <p>
      She quickly changed her intentions. She only needed one glance at her
      husband to make her rise to her feet, and go to meet him with a face full
      of wonder. &ldquo;Why! Antony! Antony, whativer hes come to thee? Thou looks&mdash;thou
      looks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How, Annie? How do I look?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Like thou looked&mdash;on thy wedding day! Whativer is it, dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie! Annie! I feel varry like I did that day. Oh, Annie, I hev got my
      life given back to me! I am going to begin it again from this varry hour!
      I am going to work, to be a big man of business, Annie. I&rsquo;m going to build
      a factory for a thousand power looms. Oh, my wife! My wife! I&rsquo;m so proud,
      so happy, I seem to hev been dead and just come back to life again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad for thee, dear. Who, or what, hes brought thee this
      wonderful good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit thee down beside me, and let me hold thy hand, or I&rsquo;ll mebbe think I
      am dreaming. Am I awake? Am I in my right mind? Or is it all a dream,
      Annie? Tell me the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell thy wife what hes happened, then I can tell thee the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a!</i> thy husband, the squire of Annis, is going to build the
      biggest and handsomest factory in the whole West Riding&mdash;going to
      fill it with steam power looms&mdash;going to manufacture woolen goods for
      the whole of England&mdash;if England will hev the sense to buy them; for
      they will be well made, and of tip-top quality. Annis village is going to
      be a big spinning and weaving town! O Annie! Annie! I see the vision. I
      saw it as I came through Piccadilly. The little village seemed to be in
      midair, and as I looked, it changed, and I saw it full of big buildings,
      and high chimneys, and hurrying men and women, and I knew that I was
      looking at what, please God, I shall live to see in reality. Annie, I hev
      begun to live this varry day. I have been in a sweet, sweet sleep for more
      than fifty years, but I hev been awakened, and now I am going to work for
      the new Annis, and redeem all the years I hev loitered away through the
      old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad for thee, Antony. Glad for thee! How is tha going to manage it?
      I am sorry Kitty and I hev made thee spend so much good gold on our
      foolishness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, I am glad you both hed all you wanted. This morning I was
      feeling down in the depths. I hedn&rsquo;t but just money enough to take us
      home, and I was wondering how iver I was to make buckle and belt meet.
      Then tha knows I got a letter from Jo-sepha, and I went to see her, and
      she told me she was going to build the biggest factory in the West Riding.
      She told me that she hed <i>made</i> money enough to do this: that it was
      Annis money, ivery farthing of it, and it was coming to Annis, and Annis
      only. Then she told me what her big plans were, bigger than I could fairly
      swallow at first, and oh, dear lass, she asked me to be her partner. I hev
      to give the land and my time. She does all the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thy sister hes a great heart. I found that out this winter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, and she found out that thou were a deal sweeter than she thought
      before, and she opened her heart to thee, and Dick, and Kitty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will she live in Annis?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not she! No one could get her away from London, and the house her Admiral
      built for her. She will come down to our regular meeting once a quarter.
      She won&rsquo;t bother thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, indeed, she won&rsquo;t! After this wonderful kindness to thee, she can&rsquo;t
      bother me. She is welcome to iverything that is mine, even to my warmest
      and truest love. The best room at Annis Hall is hers, and we will both
      love and honor her all the days of our lives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then, I am quite happy, as happy as God and His gift can make a man;
      and if I was a Methodist, I would go to their chapel at once and tell them
      all what a good and great thing God hed done for them, as well as mysen.
      Thou sees they were thought of, no doubt, when I was thought of, for God
      knew I&rsquo;d do right by His poor men and women and little childer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope, though, thou wilt stand by thy awn church. It hes stood by thee,
      and all thy family for centuries. I wouldn&rsquo;t like thee to desert the
      mother church of England.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Howiver can thou speak to me in such a half-and-half way. My prayer book
      is next to my Bible. <i>Why-a!</i> it is my soul&rsquo;s mother. I hev my
      collect for ivery day, and I say it. On the mornings I went hunting,
      sometimes I was a bit hurried, but as I stood in my bare feet, I allays
      said it, and I allays did my best to mean ivery word I said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, my love&mdash;but thou hes lately seemed to hev a sneaking
      respect for Mr. Foster, and Jonathan Hartley, and Methodists in general.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that is true. I hev a varry great respect for them. They do their
      duty, and in the main they trusted in God through these past black years,
      and behaved themsens like men. But I should as soon think of deserting
      thee as of deserting my Mother Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe thee, yet we do hev varry poor sermons, and in that way Mr.
      Foster is a great temptation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I niver minded the sermon. I hed the blessed Book of Common Prayer. And
      if the church is my soul&rsquo;s mother, then the Book of Common Prayer is
      mother&rsquo;s milk; that it is, and I wonder that thou hes niver noticed how
      faithfully I manage to say my collect. My mother taught me to say one
      ivery morning. I promised her I would. I am a man of my word, Annie, even
      to the living, and I would be feared to break a promise to the dead. I
      can&rsquo;t think of anything much worse a man could do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear one! This day God hes chosen thee to take care of his poor. We
      must get back to Annis as quickly as possible, and give them this hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So we must, but I hev a meeting to-morrow at ten o&rsquo;clock with Josepha&rsquo;s
      banker, business adviser, her lawyer, and her architect. I may be most of
      the day with his crowd. This is Monday, could tha be ready to start home
      on Thursday, by early mail coach?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will do. Now then, Annie, I hed a varry good dinner, but I want a
      cup of tea&mdash;I am all a quiver yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later in the evening Dick came in, and joined them at the supper table. He
      looked at his father and mother and wondered. He saw and felt that
      something good had happened, and in a few minutes the squire told him all.
      His enthusiasm set the conversation to a still happier tone, though Dick
      was for a moment dashed and silenced by his father&rsquo;s reply to his question
      as to what he was to look after in this new arrangement of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dick,&rdquo; answered the squire, &ldquo;thy aunt did not name thee, and when I
      did, she said: &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll find something for Dick when the time is fitting.&rsquo; 
      She said also that my time would be so taken up with watching the builders
      at work, that Dick would hev to look after his mother and the household
      affairs, till they got used to being alone all day long. Tha sees, Dick,
      we hev spoiled our women folk, and we can&rsquo;t stop waiting on them, all at
      once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dick took the position assigned him very pleasantly, and then remarked
      that Kitty ought to have been informed. &ldquo;The dear one,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;hes
      been worried above a bit about the money we were all spending. She said
      her father looked as if he had a heartache, below all his smiles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Dick thought of the political climax that Harry had spoken of, and
      asked himself if he should now speak of it. No, he could not. He could not
      do it at this happy hour. Nothing could be hindered, or helped, by the
      introduction of this painful subject, and he told himself that he would
      not be the person to fling a shadow over such a happy and hopeful
      transition in the squire&rsquo;s life. For Dick also was happy in a change which
      would bring him so much nearer to his beautiful and beloved Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed it was a very charming return home. The squire seemed to have
      regained his youth. He felt as if indeed such a marvelous change had
      actually taken place, nor was there much marvel in it. His life had been
      almost quiescent. He had been lulled by the long rust of his actually fine
      business talents. Quite frequently he had had a few days of restlessness
      when some fine railway offer presented itself, but any offer would have
      implied a curtailment, which would not result in bettering his weavers&rsquo; 
      condition, and he hesitated until the opportunity was gone. For
      opportunities do not wait, they are always on the wing. Their offer is
      &ldquo;take or leave me,&rdquo; and so it is only the alert who bid quick enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pleasant, though fatiguing drive, they reached Annis village.
      Their carriage was waiting at the coach office for them, and everyone
      lifted his cap with a joyful air as they appeared. The squire was glad to
      see that the caps were nearly all paper caps. It was likely then that many
      of his old weavers were waiting on what he had promised in his speech to
      them. And it filled his heart with joy that he could now keep that
      promise, on a large and generous scale. He saw among the little crowd
      watching the coach, Israel Naylor, and he called him in a loud, cheerful
      voice, that was in itself a promise of good, and said: &ldquo;Israel, run and
      tell Jonathan Hartley to come up to the Hall, and see me as soon as iver
      he can and thou come with him, if tha likes to, I hev nothing but good
      news for the men. Tell them that. And tell thysen the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In an hour the squire and his family and his trunks and valises and carpet
      bags were all at home again. Weary they certainly were, but oh, so happy,
      and Dick perhaps happiest of all, for he had seen Mr. Foster at his door,
      and as he drove past him, had lifted his hat; and in that silent, smiling
      movement, sent a message that he knew would make Faith as happy as
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      I need not tell any woman how happy Mistress Annis and her daughter were
      to be home again. London was now far from their thoughts. It was the new
      Annis that concerned them&mdash;the great, busy town they were to build up
      for the future. Like the squire, they all showed new and extraordinary
      energy and spirit, and as for the squire he could hardly wait with
      patience for the arrival of Jonathan Hartley and Israel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually more than twenty of the old weavers came with Jonathan, and Annie
      found herself a little bothered to get sittings for them, until the squire
      bethought him of the ballroom. Thither he led the way with his final cup
      of tea still in his hand, as in loud cheerful words he bid them be seated.
      Annie had caused the chairs to be placed so as to form a half circle and
      the squire&rsquo;s own chair was placed centrally within it. And as he took it
      every man lifted his paper cap above his head, and gave him a hearty
      cheer, and no man in England was happier at that moment than Antony Annis,
      Squire of Annis and Deeping Hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My friends!&rdquo; he cried, with all the enthusiasm of a man who has
      recaptured his youth. &ldquo;I am going to build the biggest and handsomest
      factory in Yorkshire&mdash;or in any other place. I am going to fill it
      with the best power looms that can be bought&mdash;a thousand of them. I
      am going to begin it to-morrow morning. To-night, right here and now, I am
      going to ask Jonathan to be my adviser and helper and general overseer.
      For this work I am offering him now, one hundred and fifty pounds the
      first year, or while the building is in progress. When we get to actual
      weaving two hundred pounds a year, with increase as the work and
      responsibility increases. Now, Jonathan, if this offer suits thee, I shall
      want thee at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning. Wilt tha be ready, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jonathan was almost too amazed to speak, but in a moment or two he almost
      shouted&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou fairly caps me, squire. Whativer can I say to thee? I am dumbfounded
      with joy! God bless thee, squire!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to be His messenger of comfort to you all. These are the plans
      for all who choose to take them, my old men having the preference wheriver
      it can be given. To-morrow, Jonathan and I will go over my land lying
      round Annis village within three miles, and we will pick the finest six
      acres there is in that area for the mill. We will begin digging for the
      foundation Monday morning, if only with the few men we can get round our
      awn village. Jonathan will go to all the places near by, to get others,
      and there will be hundreds of men coming from London and elsewhere,
      builders, mechanics, and such like. The architect is hiring them, and will
      come here with them. Men, these fresh mouths will all be to fill, and I
      think you, that awn your awn cottages, can get your wives to cook and wash
      for them, and so do their part, until we get a place put up for the main
      lot to eat and sleep in. Jonathan will help to arrange that business; and
      you may tell your women, Antony Annis will be surety for what-iver is just
      money for their work. Bit by bit, we will soon get all into good working
      order, and I am promised a fine factory ready for work and business in one
      year. What do you think of that, men?&rdquo; Then up went every paper cap with a
      happy shout, and the squire smiled and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You need not fear about the brass for all I am going to do, being either
      short or scrimpit. My partner has money enough to build two mills, aye,
      and more than that. And my partner is Annis born, and loves this bit of
      Yorkshire, and is bound to see Annis village keep step with all the other
      manufacturing places in England; and when I tell you that my partner is
      well known to most of you, and that her name is Josepha Annis, you&rsquo;ll hev
      no fear about the outcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No! No! Squire,&rdquo; said Jonathan, speaking for all. &ldquo;We all know the
      Admiral&rsquo;s widow. In one way or other we hev all felt her loving kindness;
      and we hev often heard about her heving no end of money, and they know thy
      word, added to her good heart, makes us all happy and satisfied. Squire,
      thou hes kept thy promise thou hes done far more than keep it. God must
      hev helped thee! Glory be to God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I hev kept my promise. I allays keep my promise to the poor
      man, just as fully as to the rich man. Tell your women that my partner and
      I are going to put in order all your cottages&mdash;we are going to put
      wells or running water in all of them, and re-roof and paint and whitewash
      and mend where mending is needed. And you men during your time of trouble,
      hev let your little gardens go to the bad. Get agate quickly, and make
      them up to mark. You knaw you can&rsquo;t do rough work with your hands, you
      that reckon to weave fine broadcloth; but there will be work of some kind
      or other, and it will be all planned out, while the building goes on, as
      fast as men and money can make it go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire,&rdquo; said Jonathan in a voice so alive with feeling, so strong and
      happy, that it might almost have been seen, as well as heard, &ldquo;Squire,
      I&rsquo;ll be here at eight in the morning, happy to answer thy wish and word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, lads, I hev said enough for to-night. Go and make your
      families and friends as happy as yoursens. I haven&rsquo;t said all I wanted to
      say, but I shall be right here with you, and I will see that not one of my
      people suffer in any way. There is just another promise I make you for my
      partner. She is planning a school&mdash;a good day school for the
      children, and a hospital for the sick, and you&rsquo;ll get them, sure enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Squire, we thank thee with all our hearts, and we will now go and ring t&rsquo; 
      chapel bell, and get the people together, and tell them all thou hes said
      would come to pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Too late to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit too late. Even if we stop there till midnight, God loves the
      midnight prayer. Oh, Squire Annis, thou hes done big things for workingmen
      in London, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I did! I wouldn&rsquo;t come home till I saw the workingmen got their
      rights. And I shall see that my men get all, and more, than I hev promised
      them. My word is my bond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the men with hearty good-bys, which is really the abbreviation of &ldquo;<i>God
      be with you!</i>&rdquo; went quickly down the hill and in half-an-hour the
      chapel bells were ringing and the squire stood at his open door and
      listened with a glad heart to them. His wife and daughter watched him, and
      then smiled at each other. They hardly knew what to say, for he was the
      same man, and yet far beyond the same. His child-likeness, and his
      pleasant bits of egotism, were, as usual, quite evident; and Annie was
      delighted to see and hear the expressions of his simple self-appreciation,
      but in other respects he was not unlike one who had just attained unto his
      majority. To have had his breakfast and be ready for a day&rsquo;s tramp at
      eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning was a wonderful thing for Antony Annis to
      promise. Yet he faithfully kept it, and had been away more than an hour
      when his wife and daughter came down to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick soon joined them, and he was not only in high spirits, but also
      dressed with great care and taste. His mother regarded him critically, and
      then became silent. She had almost instantly divined the reason of his
      careful dressing. She looked inquisitively at Katherine, who dropped her
      eyes and began a hurried and irrelative conversation about the most
      trifling of subjects. Dick looked from one to the other, and said with a
      shrug of his shoulders, &ldquo;I see I have spoiled a private conversation. I
      beg pardon. I will be away in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going so early, Dick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going to Mr. Foster&rsquo;s. I have a message to him from father, and I
      have a very important message to Faith Foster from myself.&rdquo; He made the
      last remark with decision, drank off his coffee, and rose from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, listen to your mother. Do not be in a hurry about some trivial
      affair, at this most important period of your father&rsquo;s&mdash;of all our
      lives. Nothing can be lost, everything is to be gained by a little
      self-denial on the part of all, who fear they are being neglected. Father
      has the right of way at this crisis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I acknowledge that as unselfishly as you do, mother. I intend to help
      father all I can. I could not, would not, do otherwise. Father wants to
      see Mr. Foster, and I want to see Miss Foster. Is there anything I can do
      for yourself or Kitty when I am in the village?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then good-by,&rdquo; and with a rapid glance at his sister, Dick left the room.
      Neither mother nor sister answered his words. Mistress Annis took rapid
      spoonfuls of coffee; Katherine broke the shell of her egg with quite
      superfluous noise and rapidity. For a few moments there was silence, full
      of intense emotion, and Katherine felt no inclination to break it. She
      knew that Dick expected her at this very hour to make his way easy, and
      his intentions clear to his mother. She had promised to do so, and she did
      not see how she was to escape, or delay this action. However, she
      instantly resolved to allow her mother to open the subject, and stand as
      long as possible on the defensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Annis made exactly the same resolve. Her lips quivered, her
      dropped eyes did not hide their trouble and she nervously began to prepare
      herself a fresh cup of coffee. Katherine glanced at her movements, and
      finally said, with an hysterical little laugh, &ldquo;Dear mammy, you have
      already put four pieces of sugar in your cup,&rdquo; and she laid her hand on
      her mother&rsquo;s hand, and so compelled her to lift her eyes and answer, &ldquo;Oh,
      Kitty! Kitty! don&rsquo;t you see, dearie? Dick has gone through the wood to get
      a stick, and taken a crooked one at the last. You know what I mean. Oh,
      dear me! Dear me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fear Dick is going to marry Faith Foster. Some months ago I told you
      he would do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not take into my consciousness such a calamity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say &lsquo;calamity&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Methodist preacher&rsquo;s daughter is far enough outside the pale of the
      landed aristocracy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is as good as her father and every landed gentleman, in or near this
      part of England, loves and respects, Mr. Foster. They ask his advice on
      public and local matters, and he by himself has settled disputes between
      masters and men in a way that satisfied both parties.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is quite a different thing. Politics puts men on a sort of equality,
      the rules of society keep women in the state in which it has pleased God
      to put them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless some man out of pure love lifts them up to his own rank by
      marriage. I don&rsquo;t think any man could lift up Faith. I do not know a man
      that is able to stand equal to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your awn brother, I think, ought to be in your estimation far&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick is far below her in every way, and Dick knows it. I think, mother
      dear, it is a good sign for Dick&rsquo;s future, to find him choosing for a wife
      a woman who will help him to become nobler and better every year of his
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev brought up my son to a noble standard. Dick is now too good, or at
      least good enough, for any woman that iver lived. I don&rsquo;t care who, or
      what she was, or is. I want no woman to improve Dick. Dick hes no fault
      but the one of liking women below him, and inferior to him, and unworthy
      of him:&mdash;women, indeed, that he will hev to educate in ivery way, up
      to his own standard. That fault comes his father&rsquo;s way exactly&mdash;his
      father likes to feel free and easy with women, and he can&rsquo;t do it with the
      women of his awn rank&mdash;for tha knaws well, the women of ivery station
      in life are a good bit above and beyond the men, and so&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear mammy, do you think?&mdash;oh, you know you cannot think, father
      married with that idea in his mind. You were his equal by birth, and yet I
      have never seen father give up a point, even to you, that he didn&rsquo;t want
      to give up. I think father holds his awn side with everyone, and holds it
      well. And if man or woman said anything different, I would not envy them
      the words they would get from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, of course, I could only expect that you would stand by Dick in any
      infatuation he had; the way girls and young men spoil their lives, and
      ruin their prospects, by foolish, unfortunate marriage is a miracle that
      hes confounded their elders iver since their creation. Adam fell that way.
      Poor Adam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, mammy dear, according to your belief, the woman in any class is
      always superior to the man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no society, and no social class in that time, and you know
      varry well what came of Adam&rsquo;s obedience to the woman. She must hev been
      weaker than her husband. Satan niver thought it worth his while to try his
      schemes with Adam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Adam scolded and ill-treated Eve for her foolishness!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ought to have done so. He ought to hev scolded her well and hard, all
      her life long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, of course, John Tetley, who killed his wife with his persistent
      brutality, did quite right; for his excuse was that she coaxed him to buy
      railway shares that proved actual ruin to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am tired of arguing with people who can only see one way. Your
      sister Jane, who is just like me, and who always took my advice, hes done
      well to hersen, and honored her awn kin, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, do you really think Jane&rsquo;s marriage an honor to her family?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Leyland is a peer, and a member of The House of Lords, and considered a
      clever man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A peer of three generations, a member of a House in which he dare not
      open his mouth, for his cleverness is all quotation, not a line of it is
      the breed of his own brain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he is not made after the image and likeness of Harry Bradley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, Harry is not our question now. I ask you to give Dick some good
      advice and sympathy. If he will listen to anyone, you are the person that
      can influence him. You must remember that Faith is very lovely, and beauty
      goes wherever it chooses, and does what it wants to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And both Dick and you must remember that you can&rsquo;t choose a wife, or a
      husband, by his handsome looks. You might just as wisely choose your shoes
      by the same rule. Sooner or later, generally sooner, they would begin to
      pinch you. How long hev you known of this clandestine affair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was not clandestine, mother. I told you Dick was really in love with
      Faith before we went to London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith! Such a Methodist name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Faith is not her baptismal name. She came to her father and mother as a
      blessing in a time of great trouble, and they called her <i>Consola</i>
      from the word Consolation. You may think of her as Consola. She will have
      to be married by that name. Her father wished for some private reason of
      his own to call her Faith. He never told her why.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one name is as disagreeable as the other, and the whole subject is
      disagreeable; and, in plain truth, I don&rsquo;t care to talk any more about
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I help you in anything this morning, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I will go to my room, and put away all the lovely things you bought
      me in London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You had better do so. Your father is now possessed by one idea, and he
      will be wanting every pound to further it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, too, mother, we have had our share.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you really nothing to tell me about Harry and yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could not talk of Harry this morning, mother. I think you may hear
      something from father tonight, that will make you understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. That will be soon enough, if it is more trouble,&rdquo; and though
      she spoke wearily, there was a tone of both pity and anxiety in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was only the fact of the late busy days of travel and change,
      and the atmosphere of a great reconstruction of their whole life and
      household, that had prevented Mistress Annis noticing, as she otherwise
      would have done, the pallor and sorrow in her daughter&rsquo;s appearance. Not
      even the good fortune that had come to her father, could dispel the
      sickheartedness which had caused her to maintain a stubborn silence to all
      Harry&rsquo;s pleas for excuse and pardon. Dick was his sister&rsquo;s only confidant
      and adviser in this matter, and Dick&rsquo;s anger had increased steadily. He
      was now almost certain that Harry deserved all the resentment honest love
      could feel and show towards those who had deceived and betrayed it. And
      the calamity that is not sure, is almost beyond healing. The soul has not
      forseen, or tried to prevent it. It has come in a hurry without
      credentials, and holds the hope of a &ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; in its hands; it may not
      perhaps be as bad as it appears; it may not perhaps be true. There may
      possibly be many mitigating circumstances yet not known. Poor Kitty! She
      had but this one sad circumstance to think about, she turned it a hundred
      ways, but it was always the same. However, as she trailed slowly up the
      long stairway, she said to herself&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother was talking in the dark, but patience, one more day! Either father
      or Dick will bring the truth home with them.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>IFE is full of
      issues. Nothing happens just as we expect or prepare for it, and when the
      squire returned home late in the afternoon, weary but full of enthusiasm,
      he was yet ignorant concerning the likely nomination of Bradley for the
      united boroughs of Annis and Bradley. He had walked all of fourteen miles,
      and he told his wife proudly, that &ldquo;Jonathan was more weary with the
      exercise than he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the same, Annie,&rdquo; he added, as he kissed her fondly, &ldquo;I was glad to
      see Britton with the horse and gig at the foot of the hill. That was a bit
      of thy thoughtfulness. God bless thee, dearie!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was. I knew thou hed not walked as much as tha ought to hev done
      while we were in London. I don&rsquo;t want thy fine figure spoiled, but I
      thought thou would be tired enough when thou got to the foot of the hill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I was, and Jonathan was fairly limping, but we hev settled on t&rsquo; mill
      site&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing can lick Clitheroe Moor side, just where it
      touches the river. My land covers twenty acres of it, and on its south
      edge it is almost within touch of the new railway going to Leeds. Jonathan
      fairly shouted, as soon as we stood on it. &lsquo;Squire,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;here&rsquo;s a
      mill site in ten thousand. There cannot be a finer one found in England,
      and it is the varry bit of land that man Boocock wanted&mdash;<i>and
      didn&rsquo;t get as tha knows?</i>&rsquo; Now I must write to Josepha, and tell her to
      come quickly and see it. She must bring with her also her business
      adviser.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does tha reckon to be under thy sister?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep words like those behind thy lips, and set thy teeth for a barrier
      they cannot pass. We are equal partners, equal in power and profit, equal
      in loss or gain.&rdquo; Then he was silent, and Annie understood that she had
      gone far enough. Yet out of pure womanly wilfulness, she answered&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not presume to speak another word about thy partner,&rdquo; and Antony
      Annis looked at her over the rim of his tea cup, and the ready answer was
      on his lips, but he could not say it. Her personal beauty smote the
      reproving words back, her handsome air of defiance conquered his momentary
      flash of anger. She had her husband at her feet. She knew it, and her
      steady, radiant smile completed her victory. Then she leaned towards him,
      and he put down his cup and kissed her fondly. He had intended to say &ldquo;O
      confound it, Annie! What&rsquo;s up with thee? Can&rsquo;t thou take a great kindness
      with anything but bitter biting words?&rdquo; And what he really said was&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
      Annie! Annie! sweet, dear Annie!&rdquo; And lo! there came no harm from this
      troubling of a man&rsquo;s feelings, because Annie knew just how far it was safe
      for her to go.

      This little breeze cleared the room that had been filled with unrestful
      and unfair suspicions all the day long. The squire suddenly found out it
      was too warm, and rose and opened the window. Then he asked&mdash;like a
      man who has just recovered himself from some mental neglect&mdash;&ldquo;Wheriver
      hev Dick and Kitty gone to? I hevn&rsquo;t seen nor heard them since I came
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They went to the village before two o&rsquo;clock. They went to the Methodist
      preacher&rsquo;s house, I hev no doubt. Antony, what is to come of this
      foolishness? I tell thee Dick acts as never before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hes he said to thee about Faith? How does he act?&rdquo; asked the squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hes not said so much to me as he usually does about the girl he is
      carrying-on-with, but he really believes himself in love with her for iver
      and iver.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be bound, he thinks that very thing. Dick is far gone. But the girl
      is fair and good. He might do worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like her, far from it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is always busy in some kind of work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Busy to a fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell thee what, my Joy. We shall hev to make the best we can of this
      affair. If Dick is bound to marry her, some day their wedding will come
      off. So there is no good in worrying about it. But I am sure in the long
      run, all will be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mind runs on this thing, and it troubles me. Thou ought to speak sharp
      and firm to Dick. I am sure Josepha hes other plans for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break no squares with my lad, about any woman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girls all make a dead set for Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not they! It hes allays been the other way about. We wanted him to marry
      pretty Polly Raeburn, and as soon as he found that out, he gave her up.
      That is Dick&rsquo;s awful way. Tell him he ought to marry Faith, and he will
      make easy shift to do without her. That is the short and the long of this
      matter. Now, Annie, thou must not trouble me about childish, foolish love
      affairs. I hev work for two men as strong as mysen to do, and I am going
      to put my shoulder to the collar and do it. Take thy awn way with Dick. I
      must say I hev a fellow feeling with the lad. Thou knows I suffered a
      deal, before I came to the point of running away with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What we did, is neither here nor there, the circumstances were different.
      I think I shall let things take their chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I would. Many a ship comes bravely into harbor, that hes no pilot on
      board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did tha hear any political news? It would be a strange thing if Jonathan
      could talk all day with thee, and the both of you keep off politics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, tha sees, we were out on business and business means ivery faculty
      a man hes. I did speak once of Josepha, and Jonathan said, &lsquo;She is good
      for any sum.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony, hes thou ever thought about the House of Commons since thou came
      home? What is tha going to do about thy business there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hevn&rsquo;t thought on that subject. I am going to see Wetherall about it. I
      cannot be in two places at one time, and I am going to stick to Annis
      Mill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it be any loss to thee to give up thy seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Loss or gain, I am going to stand firmly by the mill. I don&rsquo;t think it
      will be any money loss. I&rsquo;ll tell Wetherall to sell the seat to any man
      that is of my opinions, and will be bound to vote for the Liberal party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would see Wetherall soon, if I was thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the hurry? Parliament is still sitting. Grey told me it could not
      get through its present business until August or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will not be later. September guns and rods will call ivery man to the
      hills or the waters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s varry likely, and if so, they won&rsquo;t go back to London until
      December. So there&rsquo;s no need for thee to worry thysen about December. It&rsquo;s
      only June yet, tha knows.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will tha lose money by selling thy seat?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not I! I rayther think I&rsquo;ll make money. And I&rsquo;ll save a bag of
      sovereigns. London expenses hes been the varry item that hes kept us poor,&mdash;that
      is, poorer than we ought to be. There now! That will do about London. I am
      a bit tired of London. I hear Dick and Kitty&rsquo;s voices, and there&rsquo;s music
      in them. O God, what a grand thing it is to be young!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must order fresh tea for them, they are sure to be hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not they! There&rsquo;s no complaining in their voices. Listen how gayly Dick
      laughs. And I know Kitty is snuggling up to him, and saying some loving
      thing or ither. Bless the children! It would be a dull house wanting
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So it would, Annie, and thou knows it. Hev some fresh food brought for
      them. Here they are!&rdquo; And the squire rose to meet them, taking Kitty
      within his arm, and giving his hand to Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Runaways!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Whativer kept you from your eating? Mother hes
      ordered some fresh victuals. They&rsquo;ll be here anon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have had our tea, mother&mdash;such a merry meal!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheriver then?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At Mr. Foster&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Dick promptly. &ldquo;Mr. Foster came in while Kitty and
      I were sitting with Faith, and he said &lsquo;it was late, and he was hungry,
      and we had better get tea ready.&rsquo; And &lsquo;so full of fun and pleasure we all
      four went to work. Mr. Foster and I set the table, and Faith and Kitty cut
      the bread and butter, and all of us together brought on cold meat and
      Christ-Church patties, and it was all done in such a joyous mood, that you
      would have thought we were children playing at having a picnic. Oh! it was
      such a happy hour! Was it not, Kitty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed it was. I shall never forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But who can prolong a joy when it is over? Both Kitty and Dick tried to do
      so, but the squire soon turned thoughtful, and Mistress Annis, though she
      said only nice words, put no sympathy into them; and they were only words,
      and so fell to the ground lifeless. The squire was far too genial a soul,
      not to feel this condition, and he said suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;Dick, come with
      me. I hev a letter to write to thy aunt, and thou can do it for me. I&rsquo;ll
      be glad of thy help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come gladly, father. I wish you would let me do all the writing
      about business there is to be done. Just take me for your secretary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a clever idea. We will talk it out a bit later. Come thy ways
      with me, now. No doubt thy mother and sister hev their awn things to talk
      over. Women hev often queer views of what seems to men folk varry
      reasonable outcomes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So the two men went out very confidingly together, and Kitty remained with
      her mother, who sat silently looking into the darkening garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither spoke for a few minutes, then Kitty lifted her cape and bonnet and
      said, &ldquo;I am tired, mother. I think I will go to my room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varry well, but answer me a few questions first. What do you now think of
      Dick&rsquo;s fancy for Faith?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not a fancy, mother. It is a love that will never fade or grow old.
      He will marry Faith or he will never marry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such sentimentality! It is absurd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick thinks his love for Faith Foster the great fact of his life. He will
      never give her up. Her ways are his ways. He thinks as she thinks. He
      would do anything she asked him to do. Dear mammy, try and make the best
      of it. You cannot alter it. It is Destiny, and I heard Mr. Foster say,
      that no person, nor yet any nation, could fight Destiny unless God was on
      their side. I think it is Dick&rsquo;s destiny to marry Faith.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Think as you like, Katherine, but be so kind as to omit quoting Mr.
      Foster&rsquo;s opinions in my presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I do wish you would make up your quarrel with Harry Bradley; it is
      very unpleasant to have you go mourning about the house and darkening the
      only bit of good fortune that has ever come to your father. Indeed, I
      think it is very selfish and cruel. I do that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry. I try to forget, but&mdash;&rdquo; and she wearily lifted her cape
      and left the room. And her mother listened to her slow, lifeless steps on
      the stairway, and sorrowfully wondered what she ought to do. Suddenly she
      remembered that her husband had asked her not to trouble him about foolish
      love affairs and Dick was sure to take Katherine&rsquo;s view of the matter,
      whatever the trouble was; and, indeed, she was quite aware that the squire
      himself leaned to the side of the lovers, and there was no one else she
      could speak to. It was all a mixed up anxiety, holding apparently no hope
      of relief from outside help.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there was Aunt Josepha, and as soon as she stepped into the
      difficulty, Katherine&rsquo;s mother felt there would be some explanation or
      help. It was only waiting a week, and Madam Temple would be in Annis, and
      with this reflection she tried to dismiss the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, everyone in Annis Hall was now looking forward to the visit of
      Josepha. But more than a fortnight elapsed before she arrived, bringing
      with her experts and advisers of various kinds. The latter were pleasantly
      located in the village inn, and Josepha was delighted with the beautiful
      and comfortable arrangements her sister-in-law had made for her. She came
      into their life with overflowing good humor and spirits, and was soon as
      busily interested in the great building work as her happy brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had to ride all through the village to reach the mill site, and she
      did not think herself a day too old to come down to breakfast in her
      riding habit and accompany her brother. It was not long, however, before
      the pair separated. Soon after her arrival, the village women, one by one,
      renewed their acquaintance with her, and every woman looked to Miss
      Josepha for relief, or advice about their special tribulations. Many of
      them were women of her own age. They remembered her as Miss Josepha, and
      prided themselves on the superiority of their claim. To the younger women
      she was Madam, just Madam, and indeed it was a queer little incident that
      quite naturally, and without any word of explanation, made all, both old
      and young, avoid any other name than Miss Josepha. &ldquo;Yorkshire is for its
      awn folk, we doan&rsquo;t take to strange people and strange names,&rdquo; said Israel
      Naylor, when questioned by some of the business experts Josepha had
      brought down with her; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;Temple is a Beverley name, or
      I mistake, and Annis folk know nothing about Beverley names.&rdquo; So Madam
      Temple was almost universally Miss Josepha, to the villagers, and she
      liked the name, and people who used it won her favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few weeks she had to hire a room in Naylor&rsquo;s house, and go there at a
      fixed hour to see any of the people who wanted her. All classes came to
      this room, from the Episcopal curate and the Methodist preacher, to the
      poor widow of a weaver, who had gone to Bradford for work, and died of
      cholera there. &ldquo;Oh, Miss Josepha!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Jonathan Hartley told me to
      come to thee, and he said, he did say, that thou hed both wisdom and money
      in plenty, and that thou would help me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is thy trouble, Nancy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My man died in Bradford, and he left me nothing but four helpless
      childer, and I hev a sister in Bradford who will take care of them while I
      go back to my old place as pastry cook at the Black Swan Hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be a good plan, Nancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sure it would, Miss Josepha, but we awned our cottage, and our bee
      skeps, and two dozen poultry, and our old loom. I can&rsquo;t turn them into
      brass again, and so I&rsquo;m most clemmed with it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much do you want for the &lsquo;all you awn&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would count mysen in luck, if I got one hundred and fifty pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that sum its honest worth, not a penny too much, or a penny too
      little?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just what it cost us; ivery penny, and not a penny over, or less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll buy it, if all is as thou says. I&rsquo;ll hev my lawyer look it
      over, and I&rsquo;ll see what the squire says, and if thou hes been straight
      with me, thou can go home, and pack what tha wants to take with thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This incident was the initial purchase of many other cottages sold for
      similar reasons, and when Josepha went back to London, she took with her
      the title deeds of a large share of Annis village property. &ldquo;But, Antony,&rdquo;
       she said, &ldquo;I hev paid the full value of ivery deed I hold, ay, in some
      cases more than their present value, but I do not doubt I shall get all
      that is mine when the time is ripe for more, and more, and more mills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this thy plan, when thou took that room in the Inn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not it! I took it for a meeting place. I know most of the women here, and
      I saw plainly Annie would not be able to stand the constant visitations
      that were certain to follow. It made trouble in the kitchen, and the voice
      of the kitchen soon troubles the whole house. Annie must be considered,
      and the comfort of the home. That is the great right. Then I hev other
      business with Annis women, not to be mixed up with thy affairs. We are
      going to plan such an elementary school as Annis needs for its children,
      with classes at night for the women who doan&rsquo;t want their boys and girls
      to be ashamed of them. And there must be a small but perfectly fitted up
      hospital for the workers who turn sick or get injured in the mill. And the
      Reverend Mr. Bentley and the Reverend Mr. Foster come to me with their
      cases of sorrow and sickness, and I can tell thee a room for all these
      considerations was one of the necessities of our plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hevn&rsquo;t a bit of doubt of it. But it is too much for thee to manage.
      Thou art wearying soul and body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Far from it. It is as good and as great a thing to save a soul as it is
      to make it. I am varry happy in my work, and as Mr. Foster would put it, I
      feel a good deal nearer God, than I did counting up interest money in
      London.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime the home life at Annis Hall was not only changed but
      constantly changing. There was always some stranger&mdash;some expert of
      one kind or another&mdash;a guest in its rooms, and their servants or
      assistants kept the kitchen in a racket of cooking, and eating, and
      unusual excitement. Mistress Annis sometimes felt that it would be
      impossible to continue the life, but every day the squire came home so
      tired, and so happy, that all discomforts fled before his cheery &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo;
       and his boyish delight in the rapidly growing edifice. Dick had become his
      paid secretary, and in the meantime was studying bookkeeping, and learning
      from Jonathan all that could be known, concerning long and short staple
      wools.
    </p>
    <p>
      Katherine was her mother&rsquo;s right hand all the long day, but often, towards
      closing time, she went down to the village on her pony, and then the
      squire, or Dick, or both, rode home with her. Poor Kitty! Harry no longer
      wrote to her, and Josepha said she had heard that he had gone to America
      on a business speculation, &ldquo;and it is a varry likely thing,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;for Harry knew a penny from a pound, before he learned how to count. I
      wouldn&rsquo;t fret about him, dearie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not fretting, aunt, but how would you feel, if you had shut the door
      of your heart, and your love lay dead on its threshold. Nothing is left to
      me now, but the having loved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, dearie, when we hevn&rsquo;t what we love, we must love what we hev. Thou
      isn&rsquo;t a bit like thy sen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never felt young since Harry left me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a little thing to alter thee so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No trouble that touches the heart is a little thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niver mind the past, dearie. Love can work miracles. If Harry really
      loved thee he will come back to thee. Love is the old heartache of the
      world, and then all in a minute some day, he is the Healing Love and The
      Comforter. I hev a good mind to tell thee something, that I niver told to
      any ither mortal sinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it would help me to bear more cheerfully my great loss, I would be
      glad to hear anything of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Josepha sat down and spread her large capable hands one over each
      knee and looking Kitty full in the eyes said&mdash;&ldquo;I was at thy age as
      far gone in love, with as handsome a youth as your Harry is. One morning
      we hed a few words about the value of good birth, and out of pure
      contradiction I set it up far beyond what I really thought of it; though
      I&rsquo;ll confess I am yet a bit weak about my awn ancestors. Now my lover was
      on this subject varry touchy, for his family hed money, more than enough,
      but hed no landed gentry, and no coat of arms, in fact, no family. And I
      hed just hed a few words with mother, and Antony hedn&rsquo;t stood up for me.
      Besides, I wasn&rsquo;t dressed fit to be seen, or I thought I wasn&rsquo;t, and I was
      out with mother, and out with Antony, well then, I was out with mysen, and
      all the world beside; and I asked varry crossly: &lsquo;Whativer brings thee
      here at this time of day? I should hev thought thou knew enough to tell
      thysen, a girl hes no liking for a lover that comes in the morning. He&rsquo;s
      nothing but in her way.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, auntie, how could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, there was a varry boisterous wind blowing, and they do say,
      the devil is allays busy in a high wind. I suppose he came my road that
      morning, and instead of saying &lsquo;be off with thee&rsquo; I made him so
      comfortable in my hot temper, he just bided at my side, and egged me on,
      to snap out ivery kind of provoking thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very much astonished, aunt. The fair word that turneth away wrath is
      more like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sure it is, or else there hes been a great change for t&rsquo; better since
      that time. Well, that day it was thus, and so; and I hev often wondered as
      to the why and wherefore of that morning&rsquo;s foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he go away forever that morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did not come for a week, and during that week, Admiral Temple came to
      see father, and he stayed until he took with him my promise to be his wife
      early in the spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you very miserable, auntie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my dear, I was sick in love, as I could be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you make it up with him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hed several reasons for not doing so. My father hed sailed with Admiral
      Temple, and they were friends closer than brothers, for they hed saved
      each other&rsquo;s lives&mdash;that was one reason. I was angry at my lover
      staying away a whole week. That was reason number two. Ten years
      afterwards I learned, quite accidentally, that his coming was prevented by
      circumstances it was impossible for him to control. Then my mother hed
      bragged all her fine words over the country-side, about the great marriage
      I was to make. That was another reason;&mdash;and I am a bit ashamed to
      say, the splendid jewels and the rich silks and Indian goods my new lover
      sent me seemed to make a break with him impossible. At any rate, I felt
      this, and mother and father niver spoke of the Admiral that they did not
      add another rivet to the bond between us. So at last I married my sailor,
      and I thank God I did so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your lover break his heart?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it! He married soon after I was married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom did he marry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sophia Ratcliffe, a varry pretty girl from the old town of Boroughbridge.
      I niver saw her. I went with the Admiral, by permission, to various ports,
      remaining at some convenient town, while he sailed far and wide after
      well-loaded ships of England&rsquo;s enemies, and picking up as he sailed, any
      bit of land flying no civilized flag. I did not come back to Annis for
      five years. My father was then dead, my mother hed gone back to her awn
      folks, and my brother Antony was Squire of Annis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then did you meet your old lover?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day, I was walking with Antony through the village, and we met the
      very loveliest child I iver saw in all my life. He was riding a Shetland
      pony, and a gentleman walked by his side, and watched him carefully, and I
      found out at once by his air of authority that he was the boy&rsquo;s tutor. I
      asked the little fellow for a kiss, and he bent his lovely face and
      smilingly let me take what I wanted. Then they passed on and Antony said,
      &lsquo;His mother died three months ago, and he nearly broke his heart for her.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Poor little chap,&rsquo; I said, and my eyes followed the little fellow down
      the long empty street. &lsquo;His father,&rsquo; continued Antony, &lsquo;was just as
      brokenhearted. All Annis village was sorry for him.&rsquo; &lsquo;Do I know him?&rsquo; I
      asked. &lsquo;I should think so!&rsquo; answered thy father with a look of surprise,
      and then someone called, &lsquo;Squire,&rsquo; and we waited, and spoke to the man
      about his taxes. After his complaint had been attended to we went forward,
      and I remembered the child, and asked, &lsquo;What is the name of that lovely
      child?&rsquo; And Antony said, &ldquo;&lsquo;His name is Harry Bradley. His father is John
      Thomas Bradley. Hes thou forgotten him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I turned and looked after the boy, but the little fellow was nearly
      out of sight. I only got a last glimpse of some golden curls lying loose
      over his white linen suit and black ribbons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Josepha ceased speaking and silently took the weeping girl in her
      arms. She kissed her, and held her close, until the storm of sorrow was
      over, then she said softly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There it is, Lovey! The lot of women is on thee. Bear it bravely for thy
      father&rsquo;s sake. He hes a lot to manage now, and he ought not to see
      anything but happy people, or hear anything but loving words. Wash thy
      face, and put on thy dairymaid&rsquo;s linen bonnet and we will take a breath of
      fresh air in the lower meadow. Its hedges are all full of the Shepherd&rsquo;s
      rose, and their delicious perfume gives my soul a fainty feeling, and
      makes me wonder in what heavenly paradise I had caught that perfume
      before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, aunt. You have done me good, it would be a help to many girls to
      have heard your story. We have so many ideas that, if examined, would not
      look as we imagine them to be. Agatha De Burg used to say that
      &lsquo;unfaithfulness to our first love was treason to our soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t wonder, if that was her notion. She stuck through thick and thin
      to that scoundrel De Burg, and she was afraid De Burg was thinking of
      thee, and afraid thou would marry him. When girls first go into society
      they are in a bit of a hurry to get married; if they only wait a year or
      two, it does not seem such a pressing matter. Thou knows De Burg was
      Agatha&rsquo;s first love, and she hes not realized yet, that it is a God&rsquo;s
      mercy De Burg hes not kep the promises he made her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The course of true love never yet ran smooth,&rdquo; and Katherine sighed as
      she poured out some water and prepared to wash her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kitty,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;the way my life hes been ordered for me, shows
      that God, and only God, orders the three great events of ivery life&mdash;birth,
      marriage and death; that is, if we will let Him do so. Think a moment, if
      I hed married John Thomas Bradley, I would hev spent all my best days in a
      lonely Yorkshire hamlet, in the midst of worrying efforts to make work
      pay, that was too out-of-date to struggle along. Until I was getting to be
      an old woman, I would hev known nothing but care and worry, and how John
      Thomas would hev treated me, nobody but God knew. I hated poverty, and I
      would hev been poor. I wanted to see Life and Society and to travel, and I
      would hardly hev gone beyond Annis Village. Well, now, see how things came
      about. I mysen out of pure bad temper made a quarrel with my lover, and
      then perversely I wouldn&rsquo;t make it up, and then the Admiral steps into my
      life, gives me ivery longing I hed, and leaves me richer than all my
      dreams. I hev seen Life and Society, and the whole civilized world, and
      found out just what it is worth, and I hev made money, and am now giving
      mysen the wonderful pleasure of helping others to be happy. Sit thee
      quiet. If Harry is thine, he will come to thee sure as death! If he does
      not come of his awn free will, doan&rsquo;t thee move a finger to bring him.
      Thou wilt mebbe bring nothing but trouble to thysen. There was that young
      banker thou met at Jane&rsquo;s house, he loved thee purely and sincerely. Thou
      might easily hev done far worse than marry him. Whativer hed thou against
      him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was wrong with the lad&rsquo;s hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, aunt, Jane called it &lsquo;sandy&rsquo; but I felt sure it was turning towards
      red.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff and nonsense! It will niver turn anything but white, and it won&rsquo;t
      turn white till thy awn is doing the same thing. And tha knaws it doesn&rsquo;t
      make much matter what color a man&rsquo;s hair is. Englishmen are varry seldom
      without a hat of one kind or another. I doan&rsquo;t believe I would hev known
      the Admiral without his naval hat, or in his last years, his garden hat.
      Does tha remember an old lady called Mrs. Sam Sagar? She used to come and
      see thy mother, when thou was only a little lass about eight years old,
      remember her, she was a queer old lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Queer, but Yorkshire; queer, but varry sensible. Her husband, like the
      majority of Yorkshiremen, niver took off his hat, unless to put on his
      nightcap, or if he was going inside a church, or hed to listen to the
      singing of &lsquo;God Save the King.&rsquo; When he died, his wife hed his favorite
      hat trimmed with black crape, and it hung on its usual peg of the hat
      stand, just as long as she lived. You see his hat was the bit of his
      personality that she remembered best of all. Well, what I wanted to show
      thee was, the importance of the hat to a man, and then what matters the
      color of his hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time they were in the thick green grass of the meadow, and Kitty
      laughed at her aunt&rsquo;s illustration of the Yorkshire man&rsquo;s habit of
      covering his head, and they chatted about it, as they gathered great
      handfuls of shepherd&rsquo;s roses. And after this, Josepha spoke only of her
      plans for the village, and of Faith&rsquo;s interest in them. She felt she had
      said plenty about love, and she hoped the seed she had sown that afternoon
      had fallen on good ground. Surely it is a great thing to know <i>how and
      when to let go.</i>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE summer went
      quickly away, but during it the whole life of Annis Hall and Annis Village
      changed. The orderly, beautiful home was tossed up by constant visitors,
      either on business, or on simple social regulations; and the village was
      full of strange men, who had small respect for what they considered such
      an old-fashioned place. But in spite of all opinions and speculations, the
      work for which all this change was permitted went on with unceasing
      energy. The squire&rsquo;s interest in it constantly increased, and Dick&rsquo;s
      enthusiasm and ability developed with every day&rsquo;s exigencies. Then Josepha
      was constantly bringing the village affairs into the house affairs, and
      poor women with easy, independent manners, were very troublesome to
      Britton and his wife. They were amazed at the tolerance with which
      Mistress Annis permitted their frequent visits and they reluctantly
      admitted such excuses as she made for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must remember, Betsy,&rdquo; she frequently explained, &ldquo;that few of them
      have ever been in any home but their father&rsquo;s and their own. They have
      been as much mistress in their own home, as I have been in my home. Their
      ideas of what is fit and respectful, come from their heart and are not in
      any degree habits of social agreement. If they like or respect a person,
      they are not merely civil or respectful, they are kind and free, and speak
      just as they feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They do that, Madam&mdash;a good bit too free.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Betsy, they are Mistress Temple&rsquo;s business at present. Thou need
      not mind them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I doan&rsquo;t, not in the least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are finding out for her, things she wants to know about the village,
      the number of children that will be to teach&mdash;the number of men and
      women that know how to read and write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Few of that kind, Madam, if any at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know she is now making plans for a school, and she wants, of course,
      to have some idea as to the number likely to go there, and other similar
      questions. Everyone ought to know how to read and write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Madam, Britton and mysen hev found our good common senses all we
      needed. They were made and given to us by God, when we was born. He gave
      us senses enough to help us to do our duty in that state of life it had
      pleased Him to call us to. These eddicated lads are fit for nothing.
      Britton won&rsquo;t be bothered with them. He says neither dogs nor horses like
      them. They understand Yorkshire speech and ways, but when a lad gets book
      knowledge, they doan&rsquo;t understand his speech, and his ways of pronouncing
      his words; and they just think scorn of his perliteness&mdash;they kick up
      their heels at it, and Britton says they do right. <i>Why-a!</i> We all
      know what school teachers are! The varry childher feel suspicious o&rsquo; them,
      and no wonder! They all hev a rod or a strap somewhere about them, and
      they fairly seem to enjoy using it. I niver hed a lick from anybody in my
      life. I wouldn&rsquo;t hev stood it, except from dad, and his five senses were
      just as God made them; and if dad gave any o&rsquo; the lads a licking, they
      deserved it, and they didn&rsquo;t mind taking it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If they got one from a schoolmaster, I dare say they would deserve it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Madam, begging your pardon, I know instances on the contrary. My
      sister-in-law&rsquo;s cousin&rsquo;s little lad was sent to a school by Colonel
      Broadbent, because he thought the child was clever beyond the usual run of
      lads, and he got such a cruel basting as niver was, just because he
      wouldn&rsquo;t, or couldn&rsquo;t, learn something they called parts of speech&mdash;hard,
      long names, no meaning in them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was too bad. Did he try to learn them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He tried himsen sick, and Britton he tried to help him. Britton learned
      one word, called in-ter-jec-tions. He tried that word on both dogs and
      horses&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what followed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, Madam. He wanted the horses to go on, and they stood stock
      still. The dogs just looked up at him, as if they thought he hed lost his
      senses. And Britton, he said then and there, &lsquo;the Quality can hev all my
      share of grammar, and they are varry welcome to it.&rsquo; Our folk, young and
      old, learn greedily to read. Writing hes equal favor with them, arithmatic
      goes varry well with their natural senses, but grammar! What&rsquo;s the use of
      grammar? They talk better when they know nothing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So it must be confessed, Miss Josepha did not meet with the eager
      gratitude she expected. She was indeed sometimes tempted to give up her
      plans, but to give up was to Josepha so difficult and so hateful that she
      would not give the thought a moment&rsquo;s consideration. &ldquo;I hev been taking
      the wrong way about the thing,&rdquo; she said to Annie. &ldquo;I will go and talk to
      them, mysen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you will make them delighted to do all your will. Put on your bib
      and tucker, and ask Mr. Foster&rsquo;s permission to use the meeting room of the
      Methodist Chapel. That will give your plans the sacred touch women approve
      when the subject concerns themselves.&rdquo; This advice was followed, and two
      days afterward, Josepha dressed herself for a chapel interview with the
      mothers of Annis. The special invitation pleased them, and they went to
      the tryst with their usual up-head carriage, and free and easy manner,
      decidely accentuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josepha was promptly at the rendezvous appointed, and precisely as the
      clock struck three, she stepped from the vestry door to the little
      platform used by the officials of the church in all their secular
      meetings. She smiled and bowed her head and then cried&mdash;&ldquo;Mothers of
      Annis, good afternoon to every one of you!&rdquo; And they rose in a body, and
      made her a courtesy, and then softly clapped their hands, and as soon as
      there was silence, Jonathan Hartley&rsquo;s daughter welcomed her. There was
      nothing wanting in this welcome, it was brimful of honest pleasure.
      Josepha was Annis. She was the sister of their squire, she was a very
      handsome woman, and she had thought it worth while to dress herself
      handsomely to meet them. She was known to every woman in the village, but
      she had never become commonplace or indifferent. There was no other woman
      just like her in their vicinity, and she had always been a ready helper in
      all the times of their want and trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she stood up before them, she drew every eye to her. She wore or this
      occasion, her very handsomest, deepest, mourning garments. Her long
      nun-like crêpe veil would have fallen below her knees had it not been
      thrown backward, and within her bonnet there was a Maria Stuart border of
      the richest white crêpe. Her thick wavy hair was untouched by Time, and
      her stately figure, richly clothed in long garments of silk poplin, was
      improved, and not injured, by a slight <i>embonpoint</i> that gave her a
      look of stability and strength. Her face, both handsome and benign, had a
      rather austere expression, natural and approved,-though none in that
      audience understood that it was the result of a strong will, tenaciously
      living out its most difficult designs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a moment&rsquo;s delay she went straight to her point, and with vigorous
      Yorkshire idioms soon carried every woman in the place with her; and she
      knew so well the mental temperature of her audience, that she promptly
      declined their vote. &ldquo;I shall take your word, women,&rdquo; she said in a
      confident tone, &ldquo;and I shall expect ivery one of you to keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Amid loud and happy exclamations, she left the chapel and when she reached
      the street, saw that her coachman was slowly walking the ponies in an
      opposite direction, in order to soothe their restlessness. She also was
      too restless to stand still and wait their leisurely pace and she walked
      in the same direction, knowing that they must very soon meet each other.
      Almost immediately someone passed her, then turned back and met face to
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a handsome man of about the squire&rsquo;s age, and he put out his hand,
      and said with a charming, kindly manner:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a, Josepha! Josepha!</i> At last we hev met again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For just a moment Josepha hesitated, then she gave the apparent stranger
      her hand, and they stood laughing and chatting together, until the ponies
      were at hand, and had to be taken away for another calming exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hevn&rsquo;t seen you, Josepha, for twenty-four years and five months and
      four days. I was counting the space that divided us yesterday, when
      somebody told me about this meeting of Annis women, and I thought, &lsquo;I will
      just go to Annis, and hang round till I get a glimpse of her.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, John Thomas,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;it is mainly thy awn fault. Thou hed
      no business to quarrel with Antony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was Antony&rsquo;s fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it was not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, it was all my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, thou must stick to that side of the quarrel, or I&rsquo;ll not hev to know
      thee,&rdquo; and both laughed and shook hands again. Then she stepped into her
      carriage, and Bradley said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall see thee again, surely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It might so happen,&rdquo; she answered with a pretty wave of her hand. And all
      the way home she was wandering what good or evil Fate had brought John
      Thomas Bradley into her life again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she got back to the Hall, she noticed that her sister-in-law was
      worried, and she asked, &ldquo;What is bothering thee now, Annie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Josepha, Antony hed a visit from Lawyer Wetherall and he told
      Antony Annis that he hes not a particle of right to the seat in The House
      of Commons, as matters stand now. He says the new borough will be
      contested, and that Colonel Frobisher of Annis is spoken of for the
      Liberals, and Sir John Conyers or John Thomas Bradley are likely
      candidates for the Tory side of affairs. They hed a long talk and it
      wasn&rsquo;t altogether a pleasant one, and Wetherall went away in a huff, and
      Antony came to me in one of his still passions, and I hev been heving a
      varry disagreeable hour or two; and I do think Antony&rsquo;s ignorance on this
      matter quite shameful. He ought to hev known, on what right or title he
      held such an honor. I am humiliated by the circumstance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, thou needn&rsquo;t be so touchy. A great many lords and earls and
      men of high degree hev been as ignorant as Antony. Thy husband stands in
      varry good company. Antony isn&rsquo;t a bit to blame. Not he! Antony held his
      right from the people of Annis&mdash;his awn people&mdash;he did not even
      buy it, as some did. It had been his, with this authenticity, for
      centuries. Thou shared with him all of the honor and profit it brought,
      and if there was any wrong in the way it came, thou sanctioned and shared
      it. And if I was Antony I would send Wetherall to the North Pole in his
      trust or esteem. If he knew different he ought to hev told Antony
      different long ago. I shall take ivery bit of business I hev given
      Wetherall out of his hands to-morrow morning. And if he charges me a
      penny-piece too much I&rsquo;ll give him trouble enough to keep on the fret all
      the rest of his life. I will that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hev no doubt of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Antony now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wheriver that weary mill is building, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, thou ought to be a bit beyond &lsquo;supposing.&rsquo; Thou ought to <i>know</i>.
      It is thy place to know, and if he is in trouble, to be helping him to
      bear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Josepha, there is no use in you badgering and blaming me. What would you
      hev done if Wetherall hed said such and such things, in your presence, as
      he did in mine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would hev told him he was a fool, as well as a rascal, to tell at the
      end what he ought to hev told at the beginning. If Antony hed no right to
      the seat, why did he take money, year after year, for doing business
      connected with the seat; and niver open his false mouth? I shall get mysen
      clear of him early to-morrow morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go away now, Josepha. I will send someone to look for the squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will go mysen, Annie. Thank you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She found the squire in a very troubled, despondent mood. &ldquo;Josepha,&rdquo; he
      cried, &ldquo;to think that I hev been filling a position on sufferance that I
      thought was my lawful right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that rascal, Wetherall, niver said a word to thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is my awn fault. I aught to hev inquired into the matter long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then so ought the rest of the legislators. Custom becomes right, through
      length of years, and thou art not to blame, not in the least. Now,
      however, I would give it up to the people, who gave it to thee. Not to
      Wetherall! Put him out of the affair. <i>Entirely!</i> There is to be a
      meeting on the village green to-night. Go to it, and then and there say
      the words that will give thy heart satisfaction.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I intend to go, but Annie is vexed, and she makes me feel as if I hed
      done something that reflects on our honor and respectability.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thou hes done nothing of the kind. No man in all England or Scotland will
      say such a thing. Doan&rsquo;t thee take blame from anyone. If women hed to
      judge men&rsquo;s political character, ivery one would be wrong but their awn
      men folk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie thinks I hev been wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annie is peculiar. There are allays exceptions to ivery proposition.
      Annie is an exception. Dress thysen in thy handsomest field suit, and take
      thy short dog whip in thy hands; it will speed thy words more than thou
      could believe, and a crack with it will send an epithet straight to where
      it should go.&rdquo; The squire laughed and leaped to his feet. &ldquo;God bless thee,
      Josepha! I&rsquo;ll do just what tha says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then thou&rsquo;ll do right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This promise was not an easy one to keep, in the face of Annie&rsquo;s air of
      reproach and suffering; but, nevertheless, it was kept, and when the
      squire came in sight of the Green he saw a very large gathering of men
      already standing round a rude rostrum, on which sat or stood half-a-dozen
      gentlemen. Annis put his horse in the care of his servant, and stood on
      the edge of the crowd. Wetherall was talking to the newly made citizens,
      and explaining their new political status and duties to them, and at the
      close of his speech said, &ldquo;he had been instructed to propose John Thomas
      Bradley for the Protective or Tory government,&rdquo; and this proposal was
      immediately seconded by a wealthy resident of Bradley village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The squire set his teeth firmly, his lips were drawn straight and tight,
      and his eyes snapped and shone with an angry light. Then there was a
      movement among the men on the platform, and Bradley walked to the front.
      The clear soft twilight of an English summer fell all over him. It seemed
      to Annis that his old friend had never before appeared so handsome and so
      lovable. He looked at him until some unbidden tears quenched the angry
      flame in his eyes, and he felt almost inclined to mount and ride away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, however, arrested immediately by Bradley&rsquo;s words.&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
       he said with prompt decision&mdash;&ldquo;I cannot, and will not, accept your
      flattering invitation. Do any of you think that I would accept a position,
      that puts me in antagonism to my old and well-loved friend, Antony Annis?
      Not for all the honor, or power, or gold in England! Annis is your proper
      and legitimate representative. Can any of you count the generations
      through which the Annis family hes been your friends and helpers? You know
      all that the present Squire Antony hes done, without me saying a word
      about it: and I could not, and I would not, try to stand in his shoes for
      anything king or country could give me. This, on my honor, is a definite
      and positive refusal of your intended mark of respect. I accept the
      respect which prompted the honor gratefully; the honor itself, I
      positively decline. If I hev anything more to say, it is this&mdash;send
      your old representative, Antony Annis, to watch over, and speak outright,
      for your interests. He is the best man you can get in all England, and be
      true to him, and proud of him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A prolonged cheering followed this speech, and during it Squire Antony
      made his way through the crowd, and reached the platform. He went straight
      to Bradley with outstretched hands&mdash;&ldquo;John Thomas!&rdquo; he said, in a
      voice full of emotion, &ldquo;My dear, dear friend! I heard ivery word!&rdquo; and the
      two men clasped hands, and stood a moment looking into each other&rsquo;s
      love-wet eyes; and knew that every unkind thought, and word, had been
      forever forgiven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Annis stepped forward, and was met with the heartiest welcome. Never
      had he looked so handsome and gracious. He appeared to have thrown off all
      the late sorrowful years, and something of the glory of that authority
      which springs from love, lent a singular charm to this picturesque
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the side of Bradley, and still held his hand. &ldquo;My friends and
      fellow citizens!&rdquo; he cried joyfully, giving the last two words such an
      enthusiastic emphasis, as brought an instant shout of joyful triumph. &ldquo;My
      friends and fellow citizens! If anything could make it possible for me to
      go back to the House of Commons, it would be the plea of the man whose
      hand I have just clasped. As you all know, I hev pledged my word to the
      men and women of Annis to give them the finest power-loom factory in the
      West Riding. If I stick to my promise faithfully, I cannot take on any
      other work or business. You hev hed my promise for some months. I will put
      nothing before it&mdash;or with it. Men of Annis, you are my helpers, do
      you really think I would go to London, and break my promise? Not you! Not
      one of you! I shall stay right here, until Annis mill is weaving the varry
      best broadcloths and woolen goods that can be made. Ask Colonel Frobisher
      to go to London, and stand for Annis and her wool weavers. He hes little
      else to do, we all know and love him, and he will be varry glad to go for
      you. Antony Annis hes been a talking man hitherto, henceforward he will be
      a working man, but there is a bit of advice I&rsquo;ll give you now and probably
      niver again. First of all, take care how you vote, and for whom you vote.
      If your candidate proves unworthy of the confidence you gave him, mebbe
      you are not quite innocent. Niver sell your vote for any price, nor for
      any reason. Remember voting is a religious act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nay, nay, squire!&rdquo; someone in the crowd called out, with a dissenting
      laugh. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing but jobbery, and robbery, and drinking and
      quarreling in it. There is no religion about it, squire, that I can see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, Tommy Raikes, thou doesn&rsquo;t see much beyond thysen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, squire, I heard that the Methodist preacher prayed last Sunday in
      the varry pulpit about the election. Folks doan&rsquo;t like to go to chapel to
      pray about elections. It isn&rsquo;t right. Mr. Foster oughtn&rsquo;t to do such
      things. It hurts people&rsquo;s feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak for thysen, Tommy; I&rsquo;ll be bound the people were all of Mr.
      Foster&rsquo;s opinion. It is a varry important election, the varry first, that
      a great many of the people iver took a part in. And I do say, that I hev
      no doubt all of them were thankful for the prayer. There is nothing wrong
      in praying about elections. It is a religious rite, just the same as
      saying grace before your food, and thanking God when you hev eaten it.
      Just the same as putting <i>Dei gratia</i> on our money, or taking oaths
      in court, or when assuming important positions. Tommy, such simple
      religious services proclaim the sacredness of our daily life; and so the
      vote at an election, if given conscientiously, is a religious act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much hearty approval of the squire&rsquo;s opinion, and Tommy Raikes
      was plainly advised in various forms of speech to reserve his own. During
      the altercation the squire turned his happy face to John Thomas Bradley,
      and they said a few words to each other, which ended in a mutual smile as
      the squire faced his audience and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The best thing I hev to say to you this night is, in the days of
      prosperity fast coming to Annis, stick to your religion. Doan&rsquo;t lose
      yoursens in the hurry and flurry of the busy life before you all. Any
      nation to become great must be a religious nation; for nationality is a
      product of the soul. It is something for which ivery straight-hearted man
      would die. There are many good things for which a good man would not die,
      but a good man would willingly die for the good of his country. His hopes
      for her will not tolerate a probability. They hev to be realized, or he&rsquo;ll
      die for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are good Church of England men you are all right. She is your
      spiritual mother, do what she tells you to do, and you can&rsquo;t do wrong. If
      you are a Dissenter from her, then keep a bit of Methodism in your souls.
      It is kind and personal, and if it gets hold of a man, it does a lot for
      him. It sits in the center. I am sorry to say there are a great many
      atheists among weavers. Atheists do nothing. A man steeped in Methodism
      can do anything! Its love and its honesty lift up them that are cast down;
      it gives no quarter to the devil, and it hes a heart as big as God&rsquo;s
      mercy. If you hev your share of this kind of Methodist, you will be kind,
      or at least civil to strangers. You knaw how you usually treat them. The
      ither day I was watching the men budding, and a stranger passed, and one
      of the bricklayers said to another near him, &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; and the other
      looked up and answered, &lsquo;I doan&rsquo;t know. He&rsquo;s a stranger.&rsquo; And the advice
      promptly given was, &lsquo;throw a brick at him!&rsquo;&rdquo; This incident was so common
      and so natural, that it was greeted with a roar of laughter, and the
      squire nodded and laughed also, and so in the midst of the pleasant
      racket, went away with John Thomas Bradley at his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fine night,&rdquo; said Annis to Bradley. &ldquo;Walk up the hill and hev a
      bite of supper with me.&rdquo; The invitation was almost an oath of renewed
      friendship, and Bradley could on no account refuse it. Then the squire
      sent his man ahead to notify the household, and the two men took the hill
      at each other&rsquo;s side, talking eagerly of the election and its
      probabilities. As they neared the Hall, Bradley was silent and a little
      troubled. &ldquo;Antony,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how about the women-folk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am by thy side. As they treat me they will treat thee. Josepha was
      allays thy friend. Mistress Annis hed a kind side for thee, so hed my
      little Kitty. For awhile, they hev been under the influence of a lie set
      going by thy awn son.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. But Harry was misinformed, by that mean little lawyer that
      lives in Bradley. I hev forgotten the whole story, and I won&rsquo;t hev it
      brought up again. It was a lie out of the whole cloth, and was varry
      warmly taken up by Dick, and you know how our women are&mdash;they stand
      by ivery word their men say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men entered together. Josepha was not the least astonished. In fact,
      she was sure this very circumstance would happen. Had she not advised and
      directed John Thomas that very afternoon what to do, and had he not been
      only too ready and delighted to follow her advice? When the door opened
      she rose, and with some enthusiasm met John Thomas, and while she was
      welcoming him the squire had said the few words that were sufficient to
      insure Annie&rsquo;s welcome. An act of oblivion was passed without a word, and
      just where the friendship had been dropped, it was taken up again. Kitty
      excused herself, giving a headache as her reason, and Dick was in
      Liverpool with Hartley, looking over a large importation of South American
      wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event following this rearrangement of life was the return of Josepha
      to her London home. She said a combination of country life and November
      fogs was beyond her power of cheerful endurance; and then she begged
      Katherine to go back to London with her. Katherine was delighted to do so.
      Harry&rsquo;s absence no longer troubled her. She did not even wish to see him
      and the home circumstances had become stale and wearisome. The coming and
      going of many strangers and the restlessness and uncertainty of daily life
      was a great trial to a family that had lived so many years strictly after
      its own ideals of reposeful, regular rule and order. Annie, very
      excusably, was in a highly nervous condition, the squire was silent and
      thoughtful, and in the evenings too tired to talk. Katherine was eager for
      more company of her own kind, and just a little weary of Dick&rsquo;s and
      Faith&rsquo;s devotion to each other. &ldquo;I wish aunt would go to London and take
      me with her,&rdquo; she said to herself one morning, as she was rather
      indifferently dressing her own hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened that Josepha that very day found the longing for her
      own home and life so insistent that she resolved to indulge it. &ldquo;What am I
      staying here for?&rdquo; she asked herself with some impatience. &ldquo;I am not
      needed about the business yet to be, and Antony is looking after the
      preparations for it beyond all I expected. I&rsquo;m bothering Annie, and varry
      soon John Thomas will begin bothering me; and poor Kitty hes no lover now,
      and is a bit tired of Faith&rsquo;s perfections. As for Dick, poor lad! he is
      kept running between the mill&rsquo;s business, and the preacher&rsquo;s daughter. And
      Antony himsen says things to me, nobody else hes a right to say. I see
      people iverywhere whom no one can suit, and who can&rsquo;t suit themsens. I&rsquo;ll
      be off to London in two days&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll take Kitty with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josepha&rsquo;s private complaint was not without truth and her resolve was both
      kind and wise. A good, plain household undertaking was lacking; every room
      was full of domestic malaria, and the best-hearted person in the world,
      can neither manage nor yet control this insidious unhappy element. It is
      then surely the part of prudence, where combat is impossible, to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Josepha ran away, and she took her niece with her. They reached London
      in time to see the reopening of Parliament, and Mrs. Temple&rsquo;s cards for
      dinner were in the hands of her favorites within two weeks afterwards.
      Katherine was delighted to be the secretary for such writing, and she
      entered heartily into her aunt&rsquo;s plans for a busy, social winter. They
      chose the parties to carry out their pleasant ideas together, and as Kitty
      was her aunt&rsquo;s secretary, it soon became evident to both that the name of
      Edward Selby was never omitted. One or other of the ladies always
      suggested it, and the proposal was readily accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is a fine young man,&rdquo; said Josepha, &ldquo;and their bank hes a sound
      enviable reputation. I intend, for the future, to deposit largely there,
      and it is mebbe a good plan to keep in social touch with your banker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is very pleasant to dance with,&rdquo; added Kitty, &ldquo;he keeps step with
      you, and a girl looks her best with him; and then he is not always paying
      you absurd compliments.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A varry sensible partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And during the long pleasant winter this satisfaction with Selby grew to a
      very sweet and even intense affection. The previous winter Harry Bradley
      had stood in his way, but the path of love now ran straight and smooth,
      and no one had any power to trouble it. Selby was so handsome, so deeply
      in love, so desirable in every way, that Katherine knew herself to be the
      most fortunate of women. She was now also in love, really in love. Her
      affection for her child lover had faded even out of her memory. Compared
      with her passion for Selby, it was indeed a child love, just a sentimental
      dream, nursed by contiguity, and the tolerance and talk of elder people.
      Nothing deceives the young like the idea of first love&mdash;a conquering
      idea if a true one, a pretty dangerous mirage, if it is not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this affair was progressing delightfully in London things were not
      standing still in Annis. The weather had been singularly propitious, and
      the great, many-windowed building was beginning to show the length and
      breadth of its intentions. Meanwhile Squire Annis was the busiest and
      happiest man in all Yorkshire, and Annie was rejoicing in the restored
      peace and order of her household. It did not seem that there could now
      have been any cause of anxiety in the old Annis home. But there was a
      little. Dick longed to have a more decided understanding concerning his
      own marriage, but the squire urged him not to think of marriage until the
      mill was opened and at work and Dick was a loyal son, as well as a true
      lover. He knew also that in many important ways he had become a great help
      to his father, and that if he took the long journey he intended to take
      with his bride, his absence would be both a trial and a positive loss in
      more ways than one. The situation was trying to all concerned, but both
      Faith and her father made it pleasant and hopeful, so that generally
      speaking his soul walked in a straight way. Sometimes he asked his father
      with one inquiring look, &ldquo;How long, father, how long now?&rdquo; And the squire
      had hitherto always under&rsquo; stood the look, and answered promptly, &ldquo;Not
      just yet, dear lad, not just yet!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josepha and Katherine had returned from London. So continually the days
      grew longer, and brighter, and warmer, and the roses came and sent perfume
      through the whole house, as the small group of women made beautiful
      garments, and talked and wondered, and speculated; and the squire and Dick
      grew more and more reticent about the mill and its progress, until one
      night, early in July, they came home together, and the very sound of their
      footsteps held a happy story. Josepha understood it. She threw down the
      piece of muslin in her hand and stood up listening. The next moment the
      squire and his son entered the room together. &ldquo;What is it, Antony?&rdquo; she
      cried eagerly. &ldquo;<i>The mill?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mill is finished! The mill is perfect! We can start work to-morrow
      morning if we wish. It is thy doing!&rdquo; Then he turned to his wife, and
      opened his arms, and whispered his joy to her, and Annie&rsquo;s cheeks were wet
      when they both turned to Katherine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that day the women did not sew another stitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Annis village heard a startling new sound. It was the
      factory bell calling labor to its duty. And everyone listened to its
      fateful reverberations traveling over the surrounding hills and telling
      the villages in their solitary places, &ldquo;Your day also is coming.&rdquo; The
      squire sat up in his bed to listen, and his heart swelled to the impetuous
      summons and he whispered in no careless manner, &ldquo;<i>Thank God!</i>&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>MMEDIATELY after
      this event preparations for Katherine&rsquo;s marriage were revived with eager
      haste and diligence, and the ceremony was celebrated in Annis Parish
      Church. She went there on her father&rsquo;s arm, and surrounded by a great
      company of the rich and noble relatives of the Annis and Selby families.
      It was a glorious summer day and the gardens from the Hall to the end of
      the village were full of flowers. It seemed as if all nature rejoiced with
      her, as if her good angel loved her so that she had conniv&rsquo;d with
      everything to give her love and pleasure. There had been some anxiety
      about her dress, but it turned out to be a marvel of exquisite beauty. It
      was, of course, a frock of the richest white satin, but its tunic and
      train and veil were of marvelously fine Spanish lace. There were orange
      blooms in her hair and myrtle in her hands, and her sweetness, beauty and
      happiness made everyone instinctively bless her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick&rsquo;s marriage to Faith Foster was much longer delayed; not because his
      love had lost any of its sweetness and freshness, but because Faith had
      taught him to cheerfully put himself in his father&rsquo;s place. So without any
      complaining, or any explanation, he remained at his father&rsquo;s side. Then
      the Conference of the Methodist Church removed Mr. Foster from Annis to
      Bradford, and the imperative question was then whether Faith would go with
      her father or remain in Annis as Dick&rsquo;s wife. Dick was never asked this
      question. The squire heard the news first and he went directly to his son:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick, my good son, thou must now get ready to marry Faith, or else thou
      might lose her. I met Mr. Foster ten minutes ago, and he told me that the
      Methodist Conference had removed him from Annis to Bradford.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whatever have they done that for? The people here asked him to remain,
      and he wrote the Conference he wished to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just their awful way of doing &lsquo;according to rule,&rsquo; whether the rule
      fits or not. But that is neither here nor there. Put on thy hat and go and
      ask Faith how soon she can be ready to marry thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gladly will I do that, father; but where are we to live? Faith would not
      like to go to the Hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask her to do such a thing. Sir John Pomfret wants to go to
      southern France for two or three years to get rid of rheumatism, and his
      place is for rent. It is a pretty place, and not a mile from the mill. Now
      get married as quick as iver thou can, and take Faith for a month&rsquo;s
      holiday to London and Paris and before you get home again I will hev the
      Pomfret place ready for you to occupy. It is handsomely furnished, and
      Faith will delight her-sen in keeping it in fine order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What will mother say to that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just what I say. Not a look or word different. She knows thou hes stood
      faithful and helpful by hersen and by me. Thou hes earned all we can both
      do for thee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were grand words to carry to his love, and Dick went gladly to her
      with them. A couple of hours later the squire called on Mr. Foster and had
      a long and pleasant chat with him. He said he had gone at once to see Sir
      John Pomfret and found him not only willing, but greatly pleased to rent
      his house to Mr. Richard Annis and his bride. &ldquo;I hev made a good bargain,&rdquo;
       he continued, &ldquo;and if Dick and Faith like the place, I doan&rsquo;t see why they
      should not then buy it. Surely if they winter and summer a house for three
      years, they ought to know whether it is worth its price or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In this conversation it seemed quite easy for the two men to arrange a
      simple, quiet marriage to take place in a week or ten days, but when Faith
      and Mrs. Annis were taken into the consultation, the simple, quiet
      marriage became a rather difficult problem. Faith said that she would not
      leave her father until she had packed her father&rsquo;s books and seen all
      their personal property comfortably arranged in the preacher&rsquo;s house in
      Bradford. Then some allusion was made to her wardrobe, and the men
      remembered the wedding dress and other incidentals. Mistress Annis found
      it hard to believe that the squire really expected such a wedding as he
      and Mr. Foster actually planned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a, Antony!</i>&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the dear girl must have a lot to do
      both for her father and hersen. A marriage within two or three months is
      quite impossible. Of course she must see Mr. Foster settled in his new
      home and also find a proper person to look after his comfort. And after
      that is done, she will have her wedding dress to order and doubtless many
      other garments. And where will the wedding ceremony take place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Bradford, I suppose. Usually the bridegroom goes to his bride&rsquo;s home
      for her. I suppose Dick will want to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He cannot do so in this case. The future squire of Annis must be married
      in Annis church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Foster might&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Antony Annis! What you are going to say is impossible! Methodist
      preachers cannot marry anyone legally. I have known that for years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think that law has been abrogated. There was a law spoken of that was
      to repeal all the disqualifications of Dissenters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We cannot have any uncertainties about our son&rsquo;s marriage. Thou knows
      that well. And as for any hole-in-a-corner ceremony, it is impossible. We
      gave our daughter Katherine a proper, public wedding; we must do the same
      for Dick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is easy under these circumstances to see how two loving, anxious women
      could impose on themselves extra responsibilities and thus lengthen out
      the interval of separation for nearly three months. For Faith, when the
      decision was finally left to her, refused positively to be married from
      the Hall. Thanking the squire and his wife for their kind and generous
      intentions, she said without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, that &ldquo;she could not be
      married to anyone except from her father&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be a most unkind slight to the best of fathers,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
      would be an insult to the most wise and tender affection any daughter ever
      received. I am not the least ashamed of my simple home and simple living,
      and neither father nor myself look on marriage as an occasion for mirth
      and feasting and social visiting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How then do you regard it?&rdquo; asked Mistress Annis, &ldquo;as a time of solemnity
      and fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We regard it as we do other religious rites. We think it a condition to
      be assumed with religious thought and gravity. Madam Temple is of our
      opinion. She said dressing and dancing and feasting over a bridal always
      reminded her of the ancient sacrificial festivals and its garlanded
      victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The squire gave a hearty assent to Faith&rsquo;s opinion. He said it was not
      only right but humane that most young fellows hated the show, and fuss,
      and wastry over the usual wedding festival, and would be grateful to
      escape it. &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t mind saying,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that Annie and I did
      escape it; and I am sure our married life has been as near to a perfectly
      happy life as mortals can hope for in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dick also thinks as we do,&rdquo; said Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>That</i>, of course,&rdquo; replied Mistress Annis, just a little offended
      at the non-acceptance of her social plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Faith carried out her own wishes in a strict but sweetly
      considerate way. Towards the end of November, Mr. Foster had been
      comfortably settled in his new home at Bradford. She had arranged his
      study and put his books in the alphabetical order he liked, and every part
      of the small dwelling was in spotless order and comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime Annie was preparing with much love and care the Pomfret
      house for Dick and Dick&rsquo;s wife. It was a work she delighted herself in and
      she grudged neither money nor yet personal attention to make it a House
      Beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not, however, go to the wedding. It was November, dripping and
      dark and cold, and she knew she had done all she could, and that it would
      be the greatest kindness, at this time, to retire. But she kissed Dick and
      sent him away with love and good hopes and valuable gifts of lace and gems
      for his bride. The squire accompanied him to Bradford, and they went
      together to The Black Swan Inn. A great political meeting was to occur
      that night in the Town Hall, and the squire went there, while Dick spent a
      few hours with his bride and her father. As was likely to happen, the
      squire was immediately recognized by every wool-dealer present and he was
      hailed with hearty cheers, escorted to the platform, and made what he
      always considered the finest speech of his life. He was asked to talk of
      the Reform Bill and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Not I</i>! That child was born to England after a hard labor and will
      hev to go through the natural growth of England, which we all know is a
      tremendously slow one. But it will go on! It will go on steadily, till it
      comes of full age. Varry few, if any of us, now present will be in this
      world at that time; but I am sure wherever we are, the news will find us
      out and will gladden our hearts even in the happiness of a better world
      than this, though I&rsquo;ll take it on me to say that this world is a varry
      good world if we only do our duty in it and to it, and love mercy and show
      kindness.&rdquo; Then he spoke grandly for labor and the laboring man and woman.
      He pointed out their fine, though uncultivated intellectual abilities,
      told of his own weavers, learning to read after they were forty years old,
      of their unlearning an old trade and learning a new one with so much ease
      and rapidity, and of their great natural skill in oratory, both as
      regarded religion and politics. &ldquo;Working men and working women are <i>the
      hands</i> of the whole world,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;With such men as Cartwright and
      Stevenson among them, I wouldn&rsquo;t dare to say a word lessening the power of
      their mental abilities. Mebbe it was as great a thing to invent the power
      loom or conceive of a railroad as to run a newspaper or write a book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was vehemently applauded. Some time afterwards, Faith said the
      Yorkshire roar of approval was many streets away, and that her father went
      to find out what had caused it. &ldquo;He was told by the man at the door, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      nobbut one o&rsquo; them Yorkshire squires who hev turned into factory men. A
      great pity, sir!&rsquo; he added. &lsquo;Old England used to pin her faith on her
      landed gentry, and now they hev all gone into the money market.&rsquo; My father
      then said that they might be just as useful there, and the man answered
      warmly: &lsquo;And thou art the new Methodist preacher, I suppose! I&rsquo;m ashamed
      of thee&mdash;I am that!&rsquo; When father tried to explain his meaning, the
      man said: &lsquo;Nay-a! I&rsquo;m not caring what <i>tha means</i>. A man should stand
      by what he <i>says</i>. Folks hevn&rsquo;t time to find out his meanings. I&rsquo;ve
      about done wi&rsquo; thee!&rsquo; Father told him he had not done with him and would
      see him again in a few days.&rdquo; And then she smiled and added, &ldquo;Father saw
      him later, and they are now the best of friends.&rdquo; The wedding morning was
      gray and sunless, but its gloom only intensified the white loveliness of
      the bride. Her perfectly plain, straight skirt of rich, white satin and
      its high girlish waist looked etherially white in the November gloom. A
      wonderful cloak of Russian sable which was Aunt Josepha&rsquo;s gift, covered
      her when she stepped into the carriage with her father, and then drove
      with the little wedding party to Bradford parish church. There was no
      delay of any kind. The service was read by a solemn and gracious
      clergyman, the records were signed in the vestry, and in less than an hour
      the party was back at Mr. Foster&rsquo;s house. A simple breakfast for the eight
      guests present followed, and then Faith, having changed her wedding gown
      for one of light gray broadcloth of such fine texture that it looked like
      satin, came into the parlor on her father&rsquo;s arm. He took her straight to
      Dick, and once more gave her to him. The tender little resignation was
      made with smiles and with those uncalled tears which bless and consecrate
      happiness that is too great for words.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Dick&rsquo;s marriage, affairs at Annis went on with the steady regularity
      of the life they had invited and welcomed. The old church bells still
      chimed away the hours, but few of the dwellers in Annis paid any attention
      to their call. The factory bell now measured out the days and the majority
      lived by its orders. To a few it was good to think of Christmas being so
      nearly at hand; they hoped that a flavor of the old life might come with
      Christmas. At Annis Hall they expected a visit from Madam Temple, and it
      might be that Dick and Faith would remember this great home festival, and
      come back to join in it. Yet the family were so scattered that such a hope
      hardly looked for realization. Selby and Katherine were in Naples, and
      Dick and Faith in Paris and Aunt Josepha in her London home where she
      hastily went one morning to escape the impertinent clang of the factory
      bell. At least that was her excuse for a sudden homesickness for her
      London house. Annie, however, confided to the squire her belief that the
      rather too serious attentions of John Thomas Bradley were the predisposing
      grievances, rather than the factory bell. So the days slipped by and the
      squire and Jonathan Hartley were in full charge of the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      It did exceedingly well under their care, but soon after Christmas the
      squire began to look very weary, and Annie wished heartily that Dick would
      return, and so allow his father to take a little change or rest. For Annie
      did not know that Dick&rsquo;s father had been constantly adding to Dick&rsquo;s
      honeymoon holiday. &ldquo;Take another week, Dick! We can do a bit longer
      without thee,&rdquo; had been his regular postscript, and the young people, a
      little thoughtlessly, had just taken another week.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, towards the end of January, Dick and his wife returned and took
      possession of their own home in the Pomfret place. The squire had made its
      tenure secure for three years, and Annie had spared no effort to render it
      beautiful and full of comfort, and it was in its large sunny parlor she
      had the welcome home meal spread. It was Annie that met and kissed them on
      the threshold, but the squire stood beaming at her side, and the evening
      was not long enough to hear and to tell of all that happened during the
      weeks in which they had been separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course they had paid a little visit to Mr. and Mistress Selby and had
      found them preparing to return by a loitering route to London. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said
      Dick, &ldquo;they are too happy to hurry themselves. Life is yet a delicious
      dream; they do not wish to awaken just yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They cannot be &lsquo;homed&rsquo; near a factory,&rdquo; said Annie with a little laugh.
      &ldquo;Josepha found it intolerable. It made her run home very quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought she liked it. She said to me that it affected her like the
      marching call of a trumpet, and seemed to say to her, &lsquo;Awake, Josepha!
      There is a charge for thy soul to-day!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hours full of happy desultory conversation passed the joyful evening of
      reunion, but during them Dick noted the irrepressible evidences of mental
      weariness in his father&rsquo;s usually alert mind, and as he was bidding him
      good night, he said as he stood hand-clasped with him: &ldquo;Father, you must
      be off to London in two days, and not later. Parliament opens on the
      twenty-ninth, and you must see the opening of the First Reformed
      Parliament.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Why-a</i>, Dick! To be sure! I would like to be present. I would like
      nothing better. The noise of the mill hes got lately on my nerves. I niver
      knew before I hed nerves. It bothered me above a bit, when that young
      doctor we hev for our hands told me I was &lsquo;intensely nervous.&rsquo; I hed niver
      before thought about men and women heving nerves. I told him it was the
      noise of the machinery and he said it was my nerves. I was almost ashamed
      to tell thy mother such a tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Annie laughed and answered, &ldquo;Of course it was the noise, Dick, and I
      told thy father not to mind anything that young fellow said. The idea of
      Squire Annis heving what they call &lsquo;nerves.&rsquo; I hev heard weakly, sickly
      women talk of their nerves, but it would be a queer thing if thy father
      should find any nerves about himsen. Not he! It is just the noise,&rdquo; and
      she gave Dick&rsquo;s hand a pressure that he thoroughly understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to London, father, and see what sort of a job these new men make of a
      parliamentary opening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Jonathan and thysen could manage for a week without me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would do our best. Nothing could go far wrong in a week. This is the
      twenty-fifth of January, father. Parliament opens on the twenty-ninth.
      London was getting crowded with the new fellows as Faith and I came
      through it. They were crowding the hotels, and showing themselves off as
      the &lsquo;Reformed Parliament.&rsquo; I would have enjoyed hearing thee set them down
      a peg or two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then the old fire blazed in the squire&rsquo;s eyes, and he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be off
      to-morrow afternoon, Dick. I&rsquo;m glad thou told me. If there&rsquo;s anything I
      hev a contempt for it is a conceited upstart. I&rsquo;ll turn any of that crowd
      down to the bottom of their class;&rdquo; and the squire who left the Pomfret
      house that night was a very different man from the squire who entered it
      that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days afterwards the squire was off to London. He went first to the
      Clarendon and sent word to his sister of his arrival. She answered his
      note in person within an hour. &ldquo;My dear, dear lad!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My
      carriage is at the door and we will go straight home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we won&rsquo;t, Josepha. I want a bit of freedom. I want to go and come as
      I like. I want to stay in the House of Commons all night long, if the new
      members are passing compliments on each other&rsquo;s records and abilities. I
      hev come up to London to feel what it&rsquo;s like to do as I please, and above
      all, not to be watched and cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Antony! I know! Some men are too happily married. In my opinion,
      it is the next thing to being varry&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean nothing wrong, Josepha. I only want to be let alone a bit until I
      find mysen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Find thysen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure. Here&rsquo;s our medical man at the mill telling me &lsquo;I hev what he
      calls nerves.&rsquo; I hevn&rsquo;t! Not I! I&rsquo;m a bit tired of the days being all
      alike. I&rsquo;d enjoy a bit of a scolding from Annie now for lying in bed half
      the morning, and as sure as I hev a varry important engagement at the
      mill, I hear the hounds, and the <i>view, holloa!</i> and it is as much as
      I can do to hold mysen in my chair. It is <i>that</i> thou doesn&rsquo;t
      understand, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do understand. I hev the same feeling often. I want to do things I
      would do if I was only a man. Do exactly as thou feels to do, Antony,
      while the mill is out of sight and hearing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I will.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is our mill doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If tha calls making money doing well, then the Temple and Annis mill
      can&rsquo;t be beat, so far.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am glad to hear it. Wheniver the notion takes thee, come and see me. I
      hev a bit of private business that I want to speak to thee about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be sure I&rsquo;ll come and see thee&mdash;often.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll leave thee to thysen&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be obliged to thee, Josepha. Thou allays hed more sense than the
      average woman, who never seems to understand that average men like now and
      then to be left to their awn will and way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back with thee to Annis and we can do all our talking there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s sensible. We will take the early coach two weeks from to-day. I&rsquo;ll
      call for thee at eleven o&rsquo;clock, and we&rsquo;ll stay over at the old inn at
      Market Harborough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right. I&rsquo;ll go my ways now. Take care of thysen and behave thysen
      as well as tha can,&rdquo; and then she clasped his hand and went good-naturedly
      away. But as she rode home, she said to herself&mdash;&ldquo;Poor lad! I&rsquo;ll
      forgive and help him, whativer he does. I hope Annie will be as loving. I
      wonder why God made women so varry good. He knew what kind of men they
      would mebbe hev to live with. Poor Antony! I hope he&rsquo;ll hev a real good
      time&mdash;I do that!&rdquo; and she smiled and shrugged her shoulders and kept
      the rest of her speculations to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two weeks the squire had specified went its daily way, and Josepha
      received no letter from her brother, but at the time appointed he knocked
      at her door promptly and decidedly. Josepha had trusted him. She met him
      in warm traveling clothes, and they went away with a smile and a perfect
      trust in each other. Josepha knew better than to ask a man questions. She
      let him talk of what he had seen and heard, she made no inquiries as to
      what he had <i>done</i>, and when they were at Market Harborough he told
      her he had slept every hour away except those he spent in The House. &ldquo;I
      felt as if I niver, niver, could sleep enough, Josepha. It was fair
      wonderful, and as it happened there were no night sessions I missed
      nothing I wanted to see or hear. But tha knows I&rsquo;ll hev to tell Annie and
      mebbe others about The House, so I&rsquo;ll keep that to mysen till we get all
      together. It wouldn&rsquo;t bear two talks over. Would it now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be better stuff than usual if it did, Antony. Thou wilt be much
      missed when it comes to debating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall. I hev my word ready when it is the right time to say it,
      that is, generally speaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Josepha&rsquo;s visit was unexpected but Annie took it with apparent enthusiasm,
      and the two women together made such a fuss over the improvement in the
      squire&rsquo;s appearance that Josepha could not help remembering the plaintive
      remarks of her brother about being too much cared for. However, nothing
      could really dampen the honest joy in the squire&rsquo;s return, and when the
      evening meal had been placed upon the table and the fire stirred to a
      cheering blaze, the room was full of a delightful sense of happiness. A
      little incident put the finishing touch to Annie&rsquo;s charming preparation. A
      servant stirred the fire with no apparent effect. Annie then tried to get
      blaze with no better result. Then the squire with one of his heartiest
      laughs took the apparently ineffectual poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here, women!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You do iverything about a house better than
      a man except stirring a fire. Why? Because a woman allays stirs a fire
      from the top. That&rsquo;s against all reason.&rdquo; Then with a very decided hand he
      attacked the lower strata of coals and they broke up with something like a
      big laugh, crackling and sputtering flame and sparks, and filling the room
      with a joyful illumination. And in this happy atmosphere they sat down to
      eat and to talk together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Josepha had found a few minutes to wash her face and put her hair
      straight, the squire had been pottering about his wife and the luggage and
      the fire and was still in his fine broadcloth traveling suit, which with
      its big silver buttons, its smart breeches and top boots, its line of
      scarlet waistcoat and plentiful show of white cambric round the throat,
      made him an exceedingly handsome figure. And if the husbands who may
      chance to read of this figure will believe it, this good man, so carefully
      dressed, had thought as he put on every garment, of the darling wife he
      wished still to please above all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first thing the squire noticed was the absence of Dick and Faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; he asked in a disappointed tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Antony,&rdquo; said Josepha, &ldquo;Annie was just telling me that Dick hed
      gone to Bradford to buy a lot of woolen yarns; if so be he found they were
      worth the asking price, and as Faith&rsquo;s father is now in Bradford, it was
      only natural she should wish to go with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Varry natural, but was it wise? I niver could abide a woman traipsing
      after me when I hed any business on hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s where you made a mistake, Antony. If Annie hed been a business
      woman, you would hev built yoursen a mill twenty years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ay, I would, if Annie hed asked me. Not without. When is Dick to be
      home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some time to-morrow,&rdquo; answered Annie. &ldquo;He is anxious to see thee. He
      isn&rsquo;t on any loitering business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Josepha, there is no time for loitering. All England is spinning
      like a whipped top at full speed. In Manchester and Preston the wheels of
      the looms go merrily round. Oh, there is so much I want to do!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had nearly finished a very happy meal when there was a sound of men&rsquo;s
      voices coming nearer and nearer and the silver and china stopped their
      tinkling and the happy trio were still a moment as they listened. &ldquo;It will
      be Jonathan and a few of the men to get the news from me,&rdquo; said the
      squire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Antony, I thought of that and there is a roaring fire in the
      ballroom and the chairs are set out, and thou can talk to them from the
      orchestra.&rdquo; And the look of love that followed this information made
      Annie&rsquo;s heart feel far too big for everyday comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were about fifty men to seat. Jonathan was their leader and
      spokesman, and he went to the orchestra with the squire and stood by the
      squire&rsquo;s chair, and when ordinary courtesies had been exchanged, Jonathan
      said, &ldquo;Squire, we want thee to tell us about the Reform Parliament. The <i>Yorkshire
      Post</i> says thou were present, and we felt that we might ask thee to
      tell us about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sure I will. I was there as soon as the House was opened, and John
      O&rsquo;Connell went in with me. He was one of the &lsquo;Dan O&rsquo;Connell household
      brigade,&rsquo; which consists of old Dan, his three sons, and two sons-in-law.
      They were inclined to quarrel with everyone, and impudently took their
      seats on the front benches as if to awe the Ministerial Whigs who were
      exactly opposite them. William Cobbett was the most conspicuous man among
      them. He was poorly dressed in a suit of pepper and salt cloth, made
      partly like a Quaker&rsquo;s and partly like a farmer&rsquo;s suit, and he hed a white
      hat on. * His head was thrown backward so as to give the fullest view of
      his shrewd face and his keen, cold eyes. Cobbett had no respect for
      anyone, and in his first speech a bitter word niver failed him if he was
      speaking of the landed gentry whom he called &lsquo;unfeeling tyrants&rsquo; and the
      lords of the loom he called &lsquo;rich ruffians.&rsquo; Even the men pleading for
      schools for the poor man&rsquo;s children were &lsquo;education-cantors&rsquo; to him, and
      he told them plainly that nothing would be good for the working man that
      did not increase his victuals, his drink and his clothing.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * A white hat was the sign of an extreme Radical.
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that so, men?&rdquo; asked the squire. He was answered by a &ldquo;<i>No!</i>&rdquo;
       whose style of affirmation was too emphatic to be represented by written
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the Reform Bill, squire? What was said about the Reform Bill and the
      many good things it promised us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I niver heard it named, men. And I may as well tell you now that you need
      expect nothing in a hurry. All that really has been given you is an
      opportunity to help yoursens. Listen to me. The Reform Bill has taken from
      sixty boroughs both their members, and forty-seven boroughs hev been
      reduced to one member. These changes will add at least half a million
      voters to the list, and this half-million will all come from the sturdy
      and generally just, great middle class of England. It will mebbe take
      another generation to include the working class, and a bit longer to hev
      the laboring class educated sufficiently to vote. That is England&rsquo;s slow,
      sure way. It doan&rsquo;t say it is the best way, but it is <i>our</i> way, and
      none of us can hinder or hasten it. **
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     **  In 1867, during Lord Derby&rsquo;s administration, it was made
     to include the artizans and mechanics, and in Gladstone&rsquo;s
     administration, A. D. 1884, the Reform Bill was made to
     include agricultural and all day laborers.

    <p>
      &ldquo;In the meantime you have received from your own class of famous inventors
      a loom that can make every man a master. Power-loom weaving is the most
      healthy, the best paid, and the pleasantest of all occupations. With the
      exception of the noise of the machinery, it has nothing disagreeable about
      it. You that already own your houses take care of them. Every inch of your
      ground will soon be worth gold. I wouldn&rsquo;t wonder to see you, yoursens,
      build your awn mills upon it. Oh, there is nothing difficult in that to a
      man who trusts in God and believes in himsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And men, when you hev grown to be rich men, doan&rsquo;t forget your God and
      your Country. Stick to your awn dear country. Make your money in it. Be
      Englishmen until God gives you a better country, Which won&rsquo;t be in this
      world. But whether you go abroad, or whether you stay at home, niver
      forget the mother that bore you. She&rsquo;ll niver forget you. And if a man hes
      God and his mother to plead for him, he is well off, both for this world
      and the next.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is true, squire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has put us all in the varry place he thought best for the day&rsquo;s work
      He wanted from us. It is more than a bit for&rsquo;ardson in us telling Him we
      know better than He does, and go marching off to Australia or New Zealand
      or Canada. It takes a queer sort of a chap to manage life in a strange
      country full of a contrary sort of human beings. Yorkshire men are <i>all</i>
      Yorkshire. They hevn&rsquo;t room in their shape and make-up for new-fangled
      ways and ideas. You hev a deal to be proud of in England that wouldn&rsquo;t be
      worth a half-penny anywhere else. It&rsquo;s a varry difficult thing to be an
      Englishman and a Yorkshireman, which is the best kind of an Englishman, as
      far as I know, and not brag a bit about it. There&rsquo;s no harm in a bit of
      honest bragging about being himsen a Roman citizen and I do hope a
      straight for-ard Englishman may do what St. Paul did&mdash;brag a bit
      about his citizenship. And as I hev just said, I say once more, don&rsquo;t
      leave England unless you hev a clear call to do so; but if you do, then
      make up your minds to be a bit more civil to the strange people than you
      usually are to strangers. It is a common saying in France and Italy that
      Englishmen will eat no beef but English beef, nor be civil to any God but
      their awn God. I doan&rsquo;t say try to please iverybody, just do your duty,
      and do it pleasantly. That&rsquo;s about all we can any of us manage, eh,
      Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are told, sir, to do to others as we would like them to do to us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For sure! But a great many Yorkshire people translate that precept into
      this&mdash;&lsquo;Tak&rsquo; care of Number One.&rsquo; Let strangers&rsquo; religion and politics
      alone. Most&mdash;I might as well say <i>all</i>&mdash;of you men here,
      take your politics as seriously as you take your religion, and that is
      saying a great deal. I couldn&rsquo;t put it stronger, could I, Jonathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir! I doan&rsquo;t think you could. It is a varry true comparison. It is
      surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, lads, in the future, it is to be work and pray, and do the varry
      best you can with your new looms. It may so happen that in the course of
      years some nation that hes lost the grip of all its good and prudent
      senses, will try to invade England. It isn&rsquo;t likely, but it might be. Then
      I say to each man of you, without an hour&rsquo;s delay, do as I&rsquo;ve often heard
      you sing&mdash;

      &ldquo;Lads, I niver was much on poetry but when I was a varry young man, I
      learned eleven lines that hev helped me in many hours of trial and
      temptation to remember that I was an English gentleman, and so bound by
      birth and honor to behave like one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will tha say them eleven lines to us, squire? Happen they might help us a
      bit, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure of it, Jonathan.&rdquo; With these words, the kind-hearted,
      scrupulously honorable gentleman lifted his hat, and as he did so, fifty
      paper caps were lifted as if by one hand and the men who wore them rose as
      one man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may keep your standing, lads, the eleven lines are worthy of that
      honor; and then in a proud, glad enthusiasm, the squire repeated them with
      such a tone of love and such a grandeur of diction and expression as no
      words can represent:&mdash;

    <p>

      CHAPTER XIV&mdash;A RECALL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>FTER this event I
      never saw Squire Antony Annis any more. Within a week, I had left the
      place, and I was not there again until the year A. D. 1884, a period of
      fifty-one years. Yet the lovely village was clear enough in my memory. I
      approached it by one of the railroads boring their way through the hills
      and valleys surrounding the place, and as I did so, I recalled vividly its
      pretty primitive cottages&mdash;each one set in its own garden of herbs
      and flowers. I could hear the clattering of the looms in the loom sheds
      attached to most of these dwellings. I could see the handsome women with
      their large, rosy families, and the burly men standing in groups
      discussing some recent sermon, or horse race, or walking with their
      sweethearts; and perhaps singing &ldquo;The Lily of the Valley,&rdquo; or &ldquo;There is a
      Land of Pure Delight!&rdquo; I could hear or see the children laughing or
      quarreling, or busy with their bobbins at the spinning wheel, and I could
      even follow every note of the melody the old church chimes were flinging
      into the clear, sweet atmosphere above me.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reality, I had no hopes of seeing or hearing any of these things again,
      and the nearer I approached Annis Railroad Station, the more surely I was
      aware that my expectation of disappointment was a certain presage. I found
      the once lovely village a large town, noisy and dirty and full of red
      mills. There were whole streets of them, their lofty walls pierced with
      more windows than there are days in a year, and their enormously high
      chimneys shutting out the horizon as with a wall. The street that had once
      overlooked the clear fast-running river was jammed with mills, the river
      had become foul and black with the refuse of dyeing materials and other
      necessities of mill labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village had totally disappeared. In whatever direction I looked there
      was nothing but high brick mills, with enormously lofty chimneys lifted up
      into the smoky atmosphere. However, as my visit was in the winter, I had
      many opportunities of seeing these hundreds and thousands of mill windows
      lit up in the early mornings and in the twilight of the autumn evenings.
      It was a marvelous and unforget-able sight. Nothing could make commonplace
      this sudden, silent, swift appearance of light from the myriad of windows,
      up the hills, and down the hills, through the valleys, and following the
      river, and lighting up the wolds, every morning and every evening, just
      for the interval of dawning and twilight. As a spectacle it is
      indescribable; there is no human vocabulary has a word worthy of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The operatives were as much changed as the place. All traces of that
      feudal loyalty which had existed between Squire Annis and his weavers, had
      gone forever, with home and hand-labor, and individual bargaining. The
      power-loom weaver was even then the most independent of all workers. And
      men, women and children were well educated, for among the first bills
      passed by Parliament after the Reform Bill was one founding National
      schools over the length and breadth of England; and the third generation
      since was then entering them. &ldquo;Now that you have given the people the
      vote,&rdquo; said Lord Brougham, &ldquo;you must educate them. The men who say &lsquo;yes&rsquo; 
      or &lsquo;no&rsquo; to England&rsquo;s national problems must be able to read all about
      them.&rdquo; So National Schools followed The Bill, and I found in Annis a large
      Public Library, young men&rsquo;s Debating Societies, and courses of lectures,
      literary and scientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following Sunday night, I went to the Methodist chapel. The old one
      had disappeared, but a large handsome building stood on its site. The
      moment I entered it, I was met by the cheerful Methodist welcome and
      because I was a stranger I was taken to the Preacher&rsquo;s pew. Someone was
      playing a voluntary, on an exceptionally fine organ, and in the midst of a
      pathetic minor passage&mdash;which made me feel as if I had just lost Eden
      over again&mdash;there was a movement, and with transfigured faces the
      whole congregation rose to its feet and began to sing. The voluntary had
      slipped into the grand psalm tune called &ldquo;<i>Olivet</i>&rdquo; and a thousand
      men and women, a thousand West Riding voices, married the grand old Psalm
      tune to words equally grand&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Lo! He comes with clouds descending,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Once for favored sinners slain;
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      Thousand, thousand saints attending,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Swell the triumph of his train.

     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      And at this hour I am right glad, because my memory recalls that wonderful
      congregational singing; even as I write the words, I hear it. It was not
      Emotionalism. No, indeed! It was a good habit of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning I took an early train to the cathedral city of Ripon, and
      every street I passed through on my way to the North-Western Station was
      full of mills. You could not escape the rattle of their machinery, nor the
      plunging of the greasy piston rods at every window. It was not yet eight
      o&rsquo;clock, but the station was crowded with men carrying samples of every
      kind of wool or cotton. They were neighbors, and often friends, but they
      took no notice of each other. They were on business, and their hands were
      full of bundles. So full that I saw several men who could not manage their
      railway ticket, and let the conductor take it from their teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now when I travel, I like to talk with my company, but as I looked around,
      I could not persuade myself that any of these business-saturated men would
      condescend to converse with an inquisitive woman. However, a little
      further on, a very complete clergyman came into my compartment. He looked
      at me inquiringly, and I felt sure he was speculating about my social
      position. So I hastened to put him at ease, by some inquiries about the
      Annis family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O dear me!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;So you remember the old Squire Antony! How Time
      does fly! The Annis people still love and obey Squire Antony. I suppose he
      is the only person they do love and obey. How long is it since you were
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over fifty years. I saw the great Reform Bill passed, just before I left
      Annis in 1833.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean the first part of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, sir, had it more than one part?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so. It seemed to need a deal of altering and repairing. The
      Bill you saw pass was Grey&rsquo;s bill. It cleaned up the Lords and Commons,
      and landed gentlemen of England. Thirty-five years later, Derby and
      Disraeli&rsquo;s Reform Bill gave the Franchise to the great middle class,
      mechanics and artizan classes, and this very year Gladstone extended the
      Bill to take in more than two millions of agricultural and day laborers.
      It has made a deal of difference with all classes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is quite a coincidence that I should be here at the finish of
      this long struggle. I have seen the beginning and the end of it. Really
      quite a coincidence,&rdquo; and I laughed a little foolish laugh, for the
      clergyman did not laugh with me. On the contrary he said thoughtfully:
      &ldquo;Coincidences come from higher intelligences than ourselves. We cannot
      control them, but they are generally fortunate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Higher intelligences than ourselves?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Yes. This world is both
      the workfield and the battlefield of those sent to minister unto souls who
      are to be heirs of salvation, and who perhaps, in their turn, become
      comforting and helpful spirits to the children of men. Yes. A coincidence
      is generally a fortunate circumstance. Someone higher than ourselves, has
      to do with it. Are you an American?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have lived in America for half-a-century.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what part of America?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In many parts, north and south and west. My life has been full of
      changes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Change is good fortune. Yes, it is. To change is to live, and to have
      changed often, is to have had a perfect life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think the weavers of Annis much improved by all the changes that
      steam and machinery have brought to them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Machinery confers neither moral nor physical perfection, and steam
      and iron and electricity do not in any way affect the moral nature. Men
      lived and died before these things were known. They could do so again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the guard came and unlocked our carriage, and my companion gathered
      his magazines and newspapers together and the train began to slow up. He
      turned to me with a smile and said, &ldquo;Good-by, friend. Go on having
      changes, and fear not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But if I <i>do</i> fear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look up, and say:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;O Thou who changest not! Abide with me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he went away forever. I had not even asked his name, nor
      had he asked mine. We were just two wayfarers passing each other on life&rsquo;s
      highway. He had brought me a message, and then departed. But there are
      other worlds beyond this. We had perhaps been introduced for this future.
      For I do believe that no one touches our life here, who has not some
      business or right to do so. For our lives before this life and our lives
      yet to be are all one, separated only by the little sleep we call death.
    </p>
    <p>
      I reached Ripon just at nightfall, and the quiet of the cathedral city,
      its closed houses, and peaceful atmosphere, did not please me. After the
      stress and rush of the West Riding, I thought the place must be asleep. On
      the third morning I asked myself, &ldquo;What are you doing here? What has the
      past to give you? To-day is perhaps yours&mdash;Yesterday is as
      unattainable as To-morrow.&rdquo; Then the thought of New York stirred me, and I
      hastened and took the fastest train for Liverpool, and in eight days I had
      crossed the sea, and was in New York and happily and busily at work again.
    </p>
    <p>
      But I did not dismiss Annis from my memory and when the first mutterings
      of the present war was heard, I remembered Squire Antony, and his charge
      to the weavers of Annis&mdash;&ldquo;It may so happen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that in the
      course of years, some nation, that has lost the grip of all its good
      senses, will try to invade England. It isn&rsquo;t likely, but it might be so.
      Then I say to each of you, and every man of you, without one hour&rsquo;s delay,
      do as I have often heard you sing, and say you would do:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo; &lsquo;Off with your Labor Cap! rush to the van!
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      The sword for your tool, and the height of your plan
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      To turn yoursen into a fighting man<i>! </i>
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Would they do so?
    </p>
    <p>
      As I repeated the squire&rsquo;s order, I fell naturally into the Yorkshire form
      of speech and it warmed my heart and set it beating high and fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would the &lsquo;Yorkshires&rsquo; still honor the charge Squire Annis had given them?
      Oh, how could I doubt it! England had been in some war or other, nearly
      ever since the squire&rsquo;s charge, and the &lsquo;Yorkshires&rsquo; had always been soon
      and solid in rushing to her help. It was not likely that in this
      tremendous struggle, they would either be too slow, or too cold. Not they!
      Not they! They were early at the van, and doubly welcome; and they are
      helping at this hour to fight a good fight for all humanity; and learning
      the while, how to become of the highest type of manhood that can be
      fashioned in this world. Not by alphabets and books, but by the crucial
      living experiences that spring only from the courses of Life and Death&mdash;divine
      monitions, high hopes and plans, that enlarge the judgment, and the
      sympathies, the heart and the intellect, and that with such swift and
      mysterious perfection, as can only be imparted while the mortal stands on
      the very verge of Immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon, now, they will come home bringing a perfect peace with them,
      then!<i> how good will be their quiet, simple lives, and their daily
      labor, and their Paper Cap! </i>
